# Tile IR rebuild

Status: **the structural-node skeleton, the single-`factorize` emitter, and the mma tier have landed.** The tile IR is
now a tree of **structural nodes** (`Map` / `Reduction` / `Contraction`, all in `ir/tile/ir.py`) carried on a `TileOp`
with root-global schedule fields (`place` / `reduce` / `tier` / `stage` / `workers`) plus per-node schedule slices
(`Contraction.tile`, `Reduction.reduce`). `010_recognize` is the sole Loop-IR → Tile-IR boundary; `020_schedule` maps
the free axes onto the grid and stamps the partition / tile / (pin-only) warp fragment; `030_split` consumes a cross-CTA
`GRID` stage as a graph rewrite; `lowering/kernel/010_materialize` calls **one** emitter, `_factor.factorize`, per
kernel. Recovered: every elementwise / reduction / online-softmax / RMSNorm / scalar + register-tile + **mma** matmul /
scalar-flash / whole-block kernel, the cooperative (BLOCK) + register-ILP (REG) reduce tiers, the dynamic-grid tier, the
cross-CTA (GRID) split tier, and the gmem-direct `mma.sync` **warp / tensor-core matmul** (canonical + transposed-B,
f16/f32 out, fused epilogues, static + dynamic-grid, pin-driven mma split-K via the structural `Reduction ⊃ Contraction`
fork). All over **static AND symbolic** axes. **Flash lowers on the tensor-core tier** for 16-bit atom-eligible shapes (the schedule-stamped warp
`TilePlan`s + the `_twist` fragment realizer through the one `_factor._bind` binder — see the Phase-1 landed note) and
on the scalar tier otherwise — the same two-`Contraction` `TWISTED` reduce tree either way.
**The earlier `DEPLODOCK_CHAIN` warp chain was REVERTED** — it had been built as a bespoke
`_flash_warp.factorize_flash` emitter (with `_schedule` / `_factor` `is_mma_flash` bypasses and a shape-gated
`_chain_stamp`), a divergent codegen path the mandate forbids; it is deleted and its e2e cases re-xfailed until the tier
is rebuilt **through the one contraction emitter** (see Phase 1).

**Phase 0 (purge the consolidation's residue) has landed** — the
`Schedule` alias, the `_with_reduce` no-op, and the dead docstring framing are gone; the audit corrected one false
premise (the `Map.out` / `reduce_loop` reads of the flat-contraction `Map` are load-bearing, not legacy — see Phase 0
below). **Phase 1 is PARTIAL** — the symbolic-K masked mma edges landed, but the tensor-core flash was reverted (see
above) and is re-opened as a build-through-the-one-`_bind`-contraction-arm task. **Phase 2 + 3 (warp-tier operand staging)
have landed together** — the `STAGE` codec → `Stage` now lowers on the mma tier: cp.async / TMA smem-slab fill +
`ldmatrix` drain, the `d<depth>` gmem→smem ring, and the `p<reg_depth>` smem→register double-buffer, all pure
bit-identical perf transforms over the gmem-direct baseline (the transport primitives in `_stage.py`; the staged K-loop
+ `_mma_stage_plan` in `_factor.py`). The six warp-tier `STAGE` structure / bit-identity e2e tests are recovered.
**Remaining purge / follow-ups:** (a) ✅ **LANDED (both halves)** — the `_shared_row_*` fused-prologue fill lowers
through the shared `_stage.py` module (`sync_row_fill`), and the reduce-tier staging is now driven off a first-class
`Stage` stamped scheduler-side (`_schedule._row_stage` detects the shared row when the cooperative partition is chosen
and stamps a `sync` `Stage` whose `smem` names the row buffer — a derived schedule field, never a knob, so the prior
featurization is untouched); `_bind_reduce` only applies it off `ctx.stage`, the same `Stage` → apply shape the
contraction tiers follow. Bit-identical; the materialize-time detection helpers are deleted from `_factor.py`;
(a2) ✅ the mma tier's missing `sync` transport landed as the FUSED EDGE: a demoted-cone matmul under a warp
`TILE` pin nodifies to a computed-A `Contraction` (`_schedule._demoted_warp_option`) and its producer cone
COMPUTE-FILLS the A slab (`_stage.SyncTransport` / `_atom._sync_operands`), the B slab plain-copied, the `ldmatrix`
drain unchanged — `test_fused_edge.py` warp cells green for pure-MAP cones (broadcast recognition + the reduce-bearing
MONOID cone remain, see the registry); (b) scalar-tier operand staging (`test_article_tma_sgemm_reproduction`
— the fp32 SGEMM via the demolished `StageBundle` API); (c) rebuild the `find_all_bindings` bank-conflict staging oracle
(`test_bank_conflicts.py`); (d) ✅ the mma split-K auto-fork LANDED with the knob-search restoration (branch
`refactoring/knob-search-restore`): the schedule fork enumerates divisor- and occupancy-guarded `g<w>` rows (warp:
deferred-only) alongside the warp TILE / STAGE move grids — one lazy tile → stage → reduce fork tree per contraction;
(4) warp specialization (`WarpSpec`). Knob-search follow-ups recorded from that branch: the flash-form fork
(warp/chain/coop/serial as prior-ranked siblings — blocked on the AnalyticPrior cold-start refit, whose offline fitter
(`scripts/golden_knob_heuristics.py`) still imports the demolished `enumeration/_iterdag` for non-matmul kernels), and
the scalar-tier cp/tma ring (item (b) above) which the recorded scalar goldens' `d2+/tma/ring` configs need to be
reachable at all. Branch `refactoring/tile-ir-rebuild`.

## The mandate — purity, not accretion

This rebuild is a demolition, not a migration. Its output is a codebase that reads as if the old tiers never existed —
**not** one stratified with compatibility shims, "not-yet-migrated" fallbacks, and reserved-for-later fields.

The rules are absolute:

- **Zero back-compat aliases, zero re-exports "during the transition."** A renamed symbol is renamed at every call
  site in the same change; the old name does not survive one commit past its last use.
- **Zero legacy fallback branches.** Every `if it's the old form / else the new form` is a lie about the IR's
  invariants. If recognition guarantees every reduce is a `Reduction` node, then a body-scan fallback that handles a
  bare annotated `Loop` is dead code *asserting the opposite* — delete it and put an `assert isinstance(...)` in its
  place. A fallback that "can't happen" either can't (delete it) or can (a recognizer bug the fallback is hiding — fix
  the recognizer). Never both.
- **Zero divergent codegen paths.** Everything flows through the one `factorize` emitter over `Reduction` /
  `Contraction` / `Map` (see the invariant below). Two code paths that produce the same kind of kernel are one bug and
  one dead path.
- **`_factor.factorize` has exactly ONE binder — no second.** Every `TileOp` lowers through the single `_bind`
  pipeline (its arms — output-tiled contraction / tiled reduce axis / degenerate fold — are selected by which axes the
  node's SCHEDULE tiles, sealed by the one `grid_tile` finalizer), never a kernel *identity*. There is no `if is_flash(op)` / `if is_attention(op)` / `if is_<anything-named>(op)` arm. A kernel
  that "needs its own emitter" is proof the node model is wrong (fix the model), not a license to add a dispatch. The
  moment a phase adds a `factorize_<kind>` function or an `is_<kind>` dispatch predicate, it has already failed the
  mandate — the reviewer rejects it on sight. **Cautionary example (do not repeat):** tensor-core flash was landed as a
  bespoke `_flash_warp.factorize_flash` emitter with `is_mma_flash` bypasses in `_schedule` and `_factor` and a
  shape-gated `_chain_stamp` (`head_dim % 16`, `d_v % 8` — a *shape specialization*, doubly forbidden). It was reverted
  in full. The correct path is below.
- **The recovery contract is the license to delete without mercy.** `tests/compiler/e2e/` is black-box and pins
  numerics + generated source. Anything a green e2e suite does not require is, by definition, dead — remove it and let
  the suite catch you if you were wrong. No feature is kept "just in case."
- **A phase is not done when the capability works. It is done when the code it replaced no longer exists and every doc
  describes the world as it is.** The purge sub-step is not optional cleanup deferred to "later"; it ships in the same
  phase, and the phase's PR is incomplete without it.

Boldness here is not recklessness — it is *decisiveness backed by the contract*. Delete first; the e2e suite is the
proof.

## Governing invariant — one hierarchical emitter, no divergent codegen paths

Everything lowers through the **same hierarchical structure of `Reduction` / `Contraction` / `Map`**. One entry point —
`010_materialize.rewrite` calls `_factor.factorize(tile, root)` once per kernel — and one flattener, `ops.lower(op)`,
which unfolds any node tree (including nesting: `Map(source=Reduction(source=Contraction))`) back to the same loop nest.
`factorize` reads the node kind + role (`ops.axis_role`) + reduce plan (`ops.reduce_plan`) off `tile.op` and routes to a
tier that differs **only in the schedule's partition/tiling**, never in the algebra:

- a `Contraction` tiles its OUTPUT `(m, n)` axes (the four-level `atomize → register_tile → unit_tile → grid_tile`
  pipeline; both atoms — tensor-core `AtomKind` and scalar `ScalarAtom` — share it, dispatching only at `reduce_codegen`
  and the `store` sink);
- a cooperative / ILP `PLANAR` / `TWISTED` reduce (or a non-output-tiled `CONTRACTION`) tiles its REDUCE axis instead
  (`_tile_reduce_axis` — carrier-generic: a contraction is the degenerate carrier of its additive fold);
- anything else (pointwise `Map`, trivial-plan reduction) tiles nothing — the degenerate one-thread-per-cell fold.

All three are arms of the ONE `_bind` binder, sealed by the one `grid_tile` finalizer.

**The bar for every remaining phase: it lands as new data/config on a node** (a `TilePlan` atom, a `Stage`, a
`WarpSpec`) **that the one emitter already structurally supports — not a bespoke path.** Tensor-core flash is the inner
`Contraction` gaining an mma `TilePlan` + a flash `store` sink; operand staging is a `Stage` step spliced into
`reduce_codegen` symmetrically for both atoms; warp specialization is a `WarpSpec` whose roles each bottom out in a
`Map` / `Reduction` / `Contraction` sub-schedule. **If a phase needs its own emitter, the node model is wrong — fix
the model, do not fork the codegen.**

### The target — atom-as-descriptor: one pipeline, reduce/contract uniform over it

The invariant above is currently under-delivered: `_factor.py` still carries **two atom triples** (`_mma_state` /
`_mma_reduce` / `_mma_store` vs `_scalar_state` / `_scalar_reduce` / `_scalar_store`), **two staging drivers**
(`_warp_staged_kloop` / `_scalar_staged_kloop` + their two `*_stage_plan`s), and a hard split between output-tiled
(`_factorize_contraction`) and reduce-partitioned (`_factorize_reduce`) kernels. That surface area is an **artifact, not
a hardware necessity.** The real dataflow is one pipeline:

```
read (transport + layout)  →  ⊗ at atom granularity, if contracting  →  fold (+ a data-move per axis placement)  →  write
```

and the *atom* is a small **descriptor**, not a code path — it carries exactly four things:

- the operand **read** primitive + slab layout (`ldmatrix`-swizzled vs a flat plain-`Load` slab),
- the **⊗ instruction at its (M, N, K) granularity** — `mma.sync` is the lift at `16×8×16` (it fuses 16 K-steps into one
  instruction); scalar `fma` is the lift at `1×1×1`. The K-loop strides by `atom_k` and does one atom-multiply per step,
  so "contract" is uniform, parameterized by the atom shape — **not** a separate emitter;
- **lane count / ownership** (who holds which output cell — one thread per cell for scalar, a warp collectively owning a
  tile for mma; already a `unit_tile` / `lanes` parameter);
- the **output fragment layout** — the lane→(row, col) map. This is the ONE genuinely atom-specific datum, and it is
  **data** (the `FragLayout` / `M16N8` descriptor — the right instinct, deleted with the flash purge, to return as this
  parameter), consumed by the write and by any within-fragment reduction — never a fork.

Crucially, **reduce does not branch on atom.** A reduction is one **fold** plus an *optional data-move*, and the move is
keyed on **where the reduced axis sits** — within-lane (no move), within-warp (`__shfl`), within-block (smem) — a
*placement* property, which is the transport dimension, not the atom. Folding fragments and folding scalars are the same
algebra; "reduce atoms or scalars — it doesn't matter." Likewise the output-tiled vs reduce-partitioned split is just
*which axis is tiled* (the output `(m, n)` or the reduce `k`/`kv`), not two kinds of kernel.

**End-state:** collapse the six `_mma_*` / `_scalar_*` functions + the two staging drivers into **one** pipeline whose
only atom-dependent input is the descriptor above; `reduce` / `contract` / `read` / `write` are uniform over it. The bar
for the reopened **tensor-core flash** is therefore stronger than "no bespoke emitter" — it must **collapse into this
pipeline**: contract QK → fold the softmax over the score fragment (a within-fragment `__shfl` move, placement-keyed) →
contract PV → write, reusing the one contraction path with the mma atom descriptor (the returning `FragLayout` supplies
the score/PV fragment geometry). If flash — or any phase — cannot be written as a descriptor + this pipeline, the atom
model is still wrong; widen the descriptor, do not fork.

#### The skeleton to keep, and the deviations to demolish

**The skeleton (survives as the one pipeline).** `_factorize_contraction` + `_tiling.py` is the base — it is *already*
atom-agnostic (it branches nowhere on the atom; it threads the `(state_decls, reduce_region, store)` callables through
`atomize → register_tile → unit_tile → grid_tile`). It sits on the substrate that is *already* uniform and stays:

- the **algebra spine** — `ops.lower` + `ops.contraction_loop` + the `Carrier` machinery (`as_state_merge` /
  `emit_combine`): a contraction is a fold with a `⊗` lift, a reduction is the bare fold, one builder for both;
- the **geometry engine** — `_tiling.py`'s four levels, generalized to tile *whichever axis the schedule names* (the
  output `(m, n)` for a matmul, the reduce axis for a cooperative reduction — "which axis is tiled," not two kernels);
- the **transport module** — `_stage.py`;
- the node / schedule model — `Contraction` / `Reduction` / `Map` + `TilePlan` / `Stage`, plus the atom **descriptor**
  (read primitive + slab layout, `⊗` instruction at its (M, N, K) granularity, lanes / ownership, `FragLayout`).

**The tell that the rest is artifact, not hardware:** a cooperative-K **contraction** already routes to
`_factorize_reduce`, not `_factorize_contraction` — the *same node* lowers through two different tiers depending only on
its schedule. That is one kernel with two emitters: the definition of a divergent path.

**Deviations to demolish (fold each into the skeleton):**

1. **`factorize`'s three routes → one.** `_factorize_reduce` and the inline scalar tier (`lower` + `with_store`) are the
   skeleton with the *reduce* axis tiled instead of the output, and/or a trivial atom (no `⊗`). Merge them: the pipeline
   tiles the scheduled axis and folds; pointwise is the degenerate "no reduce axis," per-cell reduce is "trivial
   partition," matmul is "tile the output." One `factorize`, no `isinstance`/role fork choosing an emitter.
2. **The `_mma_*` / `_scalar_*` triples → one descriptor-driven `read → ⊗ → fold → store`.** `reduce_codegen` /
   `store_sink`'s `isinstance(c.atom, AtomKind)` branch becomes a **descriptor read**; the six functions collapse to one
   loop builder + one store that consume the atom descriptor (the scalar atom is `1×1×1`, identity layout).
3. **The two staging drivers → one.** `_warp_staged_kloop` / `_warp_tma_staged_kloop` / `_mma_stage_plan` vs
   `_scalar_staged_kloop` / `_scalar_stage_plan` become **one `Stage`-driven fill/drain** keyed on slab layout (swizzled
   for `ldmatrix` vs flat for plain-`Load`) — already the Phase-2/3 purge target, now the *whole* staging story.
4. **The fold's data-move → one placement-keyed primitive.** `emit_combine` (cross-thread), the deleted fragment
   `__shfl` (cross-lane), and `030_split`'s cross-CTA combine are the *same* "fold + move" at different placements
   (within-lane = none, within-warp = `__shfl`, within-block = smem, cross-CTA = the split finalize). One move selector
   keyed on where the reduced axis sits.

**Order (each step e2e-green):** (2) collapse the atom into a descriptor + unify the triples → (3) fold the staging
drivers onto the one `Stage` → (4) make the fold move placement-keyed → (1) merge `_factorize_reduce` + the inline scalar
tier into the skeleton, at which point `factorize` is a single pipeline call. The reopened tensor-core flash lands *on
top of this*, not before it — flash is the acceptance test that the collapse is real.

**Progress.**

- ✅ **Deviation 1, first cut — `factorize`'s three routes collapsed to two** (byte-identical, full compiler e2e green).
  The inline scalar tier is gone as a separate branch; the reduce binder owns both the cooperative/ILP partition and
  the degenerate one-thread-per-cell fold (a pointwise `Map` or trivial `ReducePlan`).
- ✅ **Deviation 1 complete — ONE root binder, one finalizer** (bit-identical across 22 dump configs — coop / ILP /
  masked coop+ILP / serial / full-row coop softmax / coop-K contraction / per-cell + tiled + staged matmuls /
  pointwise — full suite green). `_bind_contraction` / `_factorize_contraction` / `_bind_reduce` are deleted:
  `_factorize` peels the projecting `Map`s and binds the leaf via the single `_bind` pipeline, whose arms — tile the
  OUTPUT `(m, n)` axes (a `Contraction`), tile the REDUCE axis (`_tile_reduce_axis`: `coop` lanes at the unit level +
  `reg` ILP chains at the register level, returning `(state, fold, close, lane)`), or tile nothing (the degenerate
  fold, the 1×1 `atomize`) — are selected by WHICH AXES the node's schedule tiles, and ALL seal through the one
  `grid_tile` finalizer (`mn == (None, None)` = the untiled one-cell-per-thread output, the grid riding `lead_axes`,
  a tiled reduce axis contributing its lane through `t.axes`). The reduce partitioner's offset algebra (the cyclic
  `r·coop` copy offsets + the strided residual loop) intentionally stays its own arithmetic — it is the genuinely
  different distribution (cyclic vs blocked), not a divergent path.
- ✅ **Deviation 2, first cut — one contract-loop skeleton + per-atom leaf factories** (compiler e2e green; mma
  byte-identical, scalar accuracy-identical with restructured source). The gmem-direct K-loop is now the shared
  `_contract_kloop` (read each register row's A + col's B once, contract all `(row, col)` pairs, wrap in the reduce
  loop); the mma and scalar tiers supply only the four leaf constructors (`read_row` / `read_col` / `contract` / `wrap`
  — `ldmatrix`+`mma.sync` fragments vs `Load`+`fma` cells). This is a **strategy/factory refactor, not a kernel-IR
  redesign** (the earlier "needs a uniform node family" framing was wrong — that is optional Level-2 polish; keeping the
  two leaf node families behind one skeleton already removes the duplication). The scalar tier dropped `_synth_reduce` +
  `_scalar_cells` (the replicate-then-dedup mechanism) for explicit row/col reads.
- ✅ **Deviation 2 complete — `state` / `reduce` / `store` folded behind one `Atom` strategy** (`_AtomOps` +
  `_MmaOps` / `_ScalarOps`, selected by the single `_atom_ops` factory). `reduce_codegen` / `store_sink` no longer carry
  their own `isinstance(c.atom, AtomKind)` branch — there is now exactly ONE atom dispatch point. The atom is a
  strategy object bound to `(c, stage, inputs)`; the Level-2 uniform-node-family polish stays optional (not needed).
- ✅ **Deviation 3, first cut — one single-buffer staged-K-loop skeleton** (`_staged_slab_kloop`; full compiler suite
  bit-identical). The TMA and cp.async single-buffer drivers — near-identical across tiers, differing only in
  `linear_tid`, the drain leaf, and the cp gmem-clamp closures — now share one skeleton (fill → barrier/mbar → drain →
  `Sync` over the K-slab loop); `_warp_tma_staged_kloop`, `_scalar_staged_kloop`, and `_warp_staged_kloop`'s `ring == 1`
  branch all call it, supplying the `cta` / drain / gmem closures. The fill already lived in `_stage.py`; the drain is
  the atom leaf (`_staged_inner_atom_loop` ldmatrix vs `_scalar_drain` plain-`Load`).
- ✅ **Deviation 3 complete — ONE contraction K-loop driver, ONE staged driver** (bit-identical modulo the pre-existing
  nondeterministic vectorize-store gensym; compiler e2e green). `_AtomOps.reduce` on the strategy BASE is now the one
  K-loop entry for both atoms: the resolved `_StagePlan` (a uniform mode / `bk_elems` / `depth` / `reg_depth` struct
  each atom's `stage_plan` sizing returns) picks gmem-direct (`_contract_kloop`) or staged (`_atom._staged` — the one
  atom-agnostic driver that builds the operand pair, the `CtaTile` via the shared lanes-keyed `_cta`, and the
  transport). `_mma_staged` / `_scalar_staged` / the free `*_stage_plan`s are deleted; the atoms supply only descriptor
  reads (`gmem_leaves` / `staged_drain` / `slab_elem`).
- ✅ **The scheduler-side fully-resolved `Stage` — the staging decision leaves the emitter entirely** (bit-identical
  across staged, gmem-direct, AND ineligible-pin configs; compiler e2e green). A `STAGE` pin on a contraction is
  resolved at option-build time (`_schedule._resolve_warp_stage` / `_resolve_scalar_stage`, next to
  `_contraction_node` — the same resolve-once-structurally rule as the operand binding and the shared-row
  `_row_stage`): transport eligibility (`_can_stage_warp[_tma]`, moved from `_atom.py`), the slab K-chunk stored on
  the new derived `Stage.bk_elems` field (mma: `TilePlan.bk·atom_k`; scalar: the fit-to-smem derivation off the
  step-1-seeded `tile.inputs`), and the depth clamps (48 KiB budget / `reg_depth ≤ bk`; scalar pinned single-buffer) —
  stamped as the resolved `Stage`, or `None` (gmem-direct). The emitter's `stage_plan` methods and `_StagePlan` are
  deleted: `_AtomOps.reduce` just branches on `stage is not None` and applies the fields verbatim. The raw codec
  string still rides `knobs`, so `tile_signature` / featurization are untouched. WSPEC now gates on the RESOLVED
  stage (an ineligible pin leaves no pipeline for a producer role). Split-K: the pin resolves against the SLICED
  inner contraction; `030_split` still drops `stage` from its partial `TileOp`s (partials were and remain
  gmem-direct — threading it is a follow-on). The remaining genuinely-per-atom staging surface is the *apply* leaf
  (`staged_drain`) — the atom's read primitive, descriptor data by design.
- **Remaining:** (4) placement-keyed fold move (lands with the tensor-core flash, which needs the returning fragment
  shuffle).

## The recovery contract

`tests/compiler/e2e/` is the **only** thing the rebuild must satisfy. Every file there is black-box: it builds a graph,
runs it through `CudaBackend`, and compares the output to a numpy/torch reference (a handful also assert on generated
CUDA source — part of the contract too). None assert on tile-IR Python objects, so they survive any internal redesign.
The rebuild is "done" when the whole `e2e/` suite is green with an **empty** xfail registry.

## Integration-test xfail mechanism

A single registry drives expected failures during the rebuild — no scattered `@pytest.mark.xfail` decorators.

- **Registry:** `tests/xfail_registry.py` exports `XFAIL: dict[str, str]` mapping a **test node-id substring** to a
  one-line reason. `"test_foo.py"` xfails a whole file; `"test_foo.py::test_bar"` xfails one case. The
  `pytest_collection_modifyitems` hook in `tests/conftest.py` marks every collected item whose `nodeid` contains a
  registered substring with `xfail(strict=False)`.
- **Recovery semantics:** `strict=False` means a test that starts passing reports as **XPASS**, not a failure — the
  signal a capability came back. Delete its entry the moment it XPASSes; a stale xfail entry is itself dead scaffolding.
  **An empty `XFAIL` means the rebuild is fully recovered** — at which point the registry, the conftest hook, and the
  guarded `try/except ModuleNotFoundError` tile imports are all torn out too (see the Phase 4 purge).
- **A file whose module-level import of a tile symbol breaks** fails at collection — its import was guarded so it
  still collects. `TILE_ENTANGLED_FILES` is empty now.

**Deleting unit tests while rebuilding:** a tile-IR **unit** test (imports `deplodock.compiler.ir.tile` or
`…passes.lowering.tile` and asserts on those objects) → **delete it**, don't port it; the new internals get new unit
tests. An **integration/accuracy** test (anything in `tests/compiler/e2e/`) → **never delete or weaken** it; xfail it if
the in-progress rebuild breaks it, and it flips back to a hard requirement when the capability returns.

## What has landed

- **The structural-node skeleton** — the `Monoid` / `Semiring` node wrappers were **retired**; the tile IR is now `Map`
  (lift / projection, optional `source`), `Reduction` (a `PLANAR` / `TWISTED` reduce splitting its `Carrier` algebra
  from its `axis` + `partial`, the fold `Loop` synthesized on demand), and `Contraction` (a matmul before atom
  factorization), all in `ir/tile/ir.py` alongside `ir/stmt/algebra` (where the live `Carrier` / `State` / `Twist`
  algebra lives — those are carrier components, not node kinds). A `Contraction`'s A operand is `a_operand: Load | Body`
  — a gmem load **or** a computed register-resident body (flash PV's `P = exp(S − M)`). The algebra is read
  **structurally** off the annotated reduce loop / node, never a stored kind tag; `ops.lower` flattens any tree back to
  the loop nest. Flash is the **two-`Contraction` tree** `Map(source=Reduction(TWISTED, source=Contraction(Q@K),
  partial=[softmax, Contraction(P@V), O-fold]))` — both Q@K and P@V factorize through the one `_factor` path (block=1
  scalar today; the mma tier is a re-opened Phase-1 task, to land as an mma `TilePlan` on those contractions routed
  through the one `_bind` contraction arm — never a bespoke emitter, see the reverted step 3).
- **One `factorize` emitter (factorize-consolidation Part I)** — `010_materialize` is a thin wrapper;
  `_factor.factorize` is the single node-kind dispatcher (scalar / pointwise + coop-ILP reduce + tiled contraction). The
  old three-tier `010_materialize` (`_reduce` + inline scalar fallback) is gone. `reduce_codegen` (operand fragments +
  the K-loop, sink-agnostic) and the pluggable `store` sink are the shared seams; `emit_combine` /
  `carrier.as_state_merge` fold any carrier (degenerate `id` or twisted `exp`) identically.
- **The scalar + cooperative + register-tile + dynamic-grid tiers** — pointwise, per-cell reduce (plain + online
  softmax via the twist), scalar matmul, scalar flash, the BLOCK coop + REG ILP reduce partitions (combine + REG-tree
  fold derived from the plan), the scalar register-tile (`TILE` codec), and the symbolic launch grid. Static AND
  symbolic.
- **The cross-CTA (GRID) split tier** — `030_split`: `g<n>[a|k]` codec, `atomicAdd` one-kernel OR deferred
  `__partial`-workspace + combine kernel; additive `sum` / split-K AND twisted flash split-KV, carrier-generic.
- **The mma / tensor-core matmul tier** — the gmem-direct `mma.sync` `Contraction` (`_mma_state` / `_mma_reduce` /
  `_mma_store`, the `WARP` codec): canonical + transposed-B, f16/f32 out, fused epilogues, static + dynamic-grid.
  **mma split-K** via the structural fork (pin-driven; auto-fork enumeration is a Phase-1 follow-up).

## The current architecture — where the schedule lives

The combine (the ⊕ algebra + reduce/contract structure) lives in the op tree; the schedule lives on the `TileOp` and its
nodes. **Root-global** `TileOp` fields: `place` (`Placement`), `reduce` (`ReducePlan` for a not-yet-nodified reduce),
`tier` (`TilePlan` for a non-tiled contraction), `stage` (`Stage` — materialization currently dropped), `workers`
(`WarpSpec` — not yet built). **Per-node** slices: `Contraction.tile` (a `TilePlan` carrying the leaf `atom` +
unit/register widths + K-chunk), `Reduction.reduce` (the partition). There is no per-kind schedule *type*: the role is
read structurally, the materializer reads the schedule straight off the node. `ops.reduce_plan` reads the partition off
a `Reduction` node **or falls back to `TileOp.reduce`** for the not-yet-nodified coop/ILP-K contraction — a Phase-1
purge target.

### The knob schema — shared orthogonal codes

A schedule is **spelled** by orthogonal codes, one per tunable sub-component; a kernel's config is the union that
applies. One vocabulary, learned-feature generalization across kinds (the featurizer reads one code kind-agnostically);
**not** cross-kind measured-evidence sharing (`op_cache_key` silos `perf` rows by kind).

| code | sub-component | where | grammar (coarse→fine) | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `REDUCE` | `ReducePlan` (reduce-axis partition) | `Reduction`, non-tiled `Contraction` | `g<n>[a\|k]` / `b<n>` / `r<n>` · empty = serial | **built** |
| `TILE` | scalar output tile (`TilePlan` — par + reg) | `Contraction` (scalar atom) | `n<N>[xm<M>]` par · `f<fn>[xf<fm>]` reg · empty = per-cell | **built** |
| `WARP` | mma fragment (`TilePlan` w/ tensor-core atom) | `Contraction` (mma atom) | `a:<atom>` · `w<WM>xw<WN>` · `f<FM>xf<FN>` · `k<bk>` | **built + enumerated** |
| `STAGE` | `Stage` (operand pipeline) | `Reduction`, `Contraction` | `d<depth>` ring · `sync\|cp\|tma` · `[ring]` · `[p<reg_depth>]` · empty = gmem-direct | **built + enumerated** (resolver-gated) |

**Delimiter hierarchy** (so codes survive the `DEPLODOCK_KNOBS` / `run --ab` parser): **`,` is reserved** as the
knob-list separator and MUST NOT appear inside a code value. Within a value: `/` separates fields, `x` pairs dims, `:`
introduces a name (`a:<atom>`), `;` lists. Sub-field order is fixed **m-then-n**. Interpretation is per-node-kind
(`REDUCE b32` partitions *the* reduce axis — a `Reduction` reads its reduce axis, a `Contraction` reads K); fragment is
implicit in which output code is present (`TILE` ⇒ scalar atom, `WARP` ⇒ mma atom, never both).

## Phase 0 — Purge the consolidation's residue (do first; blocks nothing)

The landed consolidation left shims and lies behind. Delete them **before** building on top, so the new phases stand on
clean ground. All e2e-covered; each deletion is proven by the suite staying green.

- **Kill `Schedule = Placement`** (`ir/tile/ir.py`) — the "kept re-exported during the transition" alias. Rewrite every
  `Schedule` reference to `Placement`, delete the alias and its two-line apology.
- **The `Map.out` annotated-`Loop` branch and the `ops.reduce_loop` body-scan are BOTH load-bearing — not legacy.**
  The plan's premise ("recognition nodifies every reduce/contraction") is **false for contractions**, verified against
  the e2e suite. Recognition emits every **reduce** as a `Reduction` node (bare) or `Map(source=Reduction)` (projected),
  but a **contraction** rides a flat `Map(body=(annotated CONTRACTION loop, …))`: a *tiled* / warp / split-K contraction
  is nodified to a `Contraction` by `_schedule`, but a **scalar per-cell contraction keeps the flat `Map` all the way
  through materialize** (deleting the `Map.out` `carrier.out` arm broke every scalar-matmul e2e test — `_store`'s
  store-glue reads `op.out` off that loop's carrier). Likewise `reduce_loop`'s body-scan reads the K loop off the
  pre-nodification flat `Map` (`_contraction_node` / `_check_warp_static_k` / `axis_role`), and `030_split`'s
  finalize/partial kernels carry sliced reduce loops. The node can't be built at recognize time (its `tile` is a
  fork-chosen `TilePlan`; its operand binding needs the mapped `place.grid`). **Both branches stay** and their
  docstrings now describe the flat-contraction `Map` as a real current form. Fully retiring the body-scan would need a
  recognizer refactor (nodify the scalar contraction too, with a deferred `tile`) — a real follow-up, not Phase-0
  residue.
- **Delete `_schedule._with_reduce`'s "returns the op unchanged for a legacy non-`Reduction` op" no-op path** and the
  sibling legacy-pin branches (`_schedule.py` ~158/164/218) — same principle: if the stamp target always exists, the
  no-op arm is dead.
- **Reconcile the docstrings to reality.** Strike every "not-yet-migrated" / "legacy form" / "residual fallback" /
  "reserved during the transition" phrase from `ir/tile/ir.py`, `ir/tile/ops.py`, `_atomize.py` (its `Semiring` /
  `Monoid` op-tree reference), and `_schedule.py`. A docstring that describes a fallback you just deleted is a document
  inconsistency — the audit is not done until grep for those phrases over `ir/tile/` + `passes/lowering/` is empty.
- **Resolve the STAGE "built vs dropped" contradiction now.** The knob table says built, `_factor.py`'s docstring says
  dropped, `kernel/ARCHITECTURE.md` says "reserved", and `xfail_registry._STAGE` says materialization is gone. Pick one
  truth — *materialization dropped, codec stamps* — and make all four say it verbatim (the table above already does).

## The remaining phases — build, then purge

Ordered as requested. Each phase adds config the `factorize` path already structurally supports (no divergent path),
**then immediately deletes what it obsoletes.** Named tests flip XPASS → delete the xfail entry.

### Phase 1 — finish mma (tensor-core flash + symbolic-K masked edges)

**Build.** Two mma capabilities remain, both reusing the existing `Contraction` mma codegen through the node hierarchy.

#### Tensor-core flash — RE-PLANNED: two `Contraction` nodes over a blocked kv (architecture first)

The original plan said "give the flash tree's **inner** `Contraction` an mma `TilePlan`," as if flash already had the
right shape. It does not, and the gap is architectural, not a wiring oversight. The current flash op tree
(`_flash._flash_op`) is:

```
Map(body=[O_i / l_i],
    source=Reduction(role=TWISTED, axis=kv,
        carrier=flash_combine(m_i, l_i, O_i, score, v),   # (max, denom, EXPECT=O) twist
        source=Contraction(QK: S = Σ_dd Q·K),             # the ONLY contraction node
        partial=[scale/mask S, load V, carrier.dissolve()]))
```

Only **QK** is a `Contraction`. **PV is dissolved into the twisted carrier's expectation channel** — `O_i` folds
`O_i·α + p·v` **per single kv element**, so the "P@V" is a rank-1 FMA whose reduce axis *is* the streaming `kv` axis, not
a separate contraction. And `d` (the value dim) is a **grid axis** — one output column per thread, the score recomputed
redundantly for every `d`. mma needs the opposite: `d` inside a PV output **tile**, and `P@V` as a real tiled
contraction. So the scalar tree cannot be "given an mma TilePlan"; it must be **restructured**.

**The clean architecture the user asked for — both QK and PV are `Contraction` nodes, over a *blocked* kv.** Split the
streaming axis into `(kv_block, j)`; stream over `kv_block`, contract within the block:

```
Map(body=[O_i / l_i],
    source=Reduction(role=TWISTED, axis=kv_block,
        carrier=<(m_i, l_i) softmax stats + the O_i rescale>,   # O is NO LONGER a carrier expectation channel
        source=Contraction(QK: S[m, j] = Σ_dd Q·K),             # reduce dd → score tile  (b_trans)
        partial=[<softmax on S → P[m, j], α, rowsum>,
                 Contraction(PV: Oblk[m, d] = Σ_j P·V),         # reduce j → output tile
                 <carrier merge: O_i = O_i·α + Oblk>]))
```

Now QK reduces `dd` and PV reduces the intra-block `j` — **different axes** from the streaming `kv_block`, so neither
duplicates the streaming reduce. The `expect(v)` channel's `lift` (already carried on `Channel` for exactly this — see
its docstring, "a future fragment realizer can lower ⊗ to a contraction (mma)") is **realized as the PV `Contraction`**:
its per-element `p·v` term becomes the PV output `Oblk`, so the carrier keeps its `(m_i, l_i)` stats **and** the O-fold
`O_i = O_i·α + Oblk` (α still generated internally), but the ⊗ is now a tiled contraction node instead of a scalar FMA.
Both contractions factorize through the **same** `_bind` contraction arm; the tier is chosen by each node's `TilePlan`,
never a divergent path.

**Consolidation steps (architecture first, each kept green by the non-xfailed *scalar* flash e2e):**

1. ✅ **Structural seam — a reduce `partial` can carry a nested `Contraction`.** `Reduction.loop` now flattens a
   `Contraction` (a `Stmt`) sitting in its `partial` to its own loop nest in place (`_flatten_nodes`), the same
   recursion the `source` splice does. Backward-compatible (a no-op for a plain partial → every existing reduce lowers
   byte-identically); pinned by `test_reduce_partial_flattens_a_nested_pv_contraction`. This is the QK-on-`source` +
   PV-in-`partial` capability the two-`Contraction` tree rests on. (Step 3's mma tier will factorize the nested PV
   instead of flattening it — `factorize` recursion is a step-3 concern.)
2. ✅ **Rebuilt `_flash._flash_op` to the blocked two-`Contraction` tree (block=1).** `_split_pv`
   (`_flash.py`) rewrites the exp carrier's dissolved `merge` so the expectation fold `O_i = O_i·α + v·P` is redirected
   through a real **PV `Contraction`** `O_i__pv = Σ_j P·V` whose **A operand is the register-resident `P`** (a `copy`
   rebind of the exp weight the carrier already computes — extracted structurally off the `O_i` Accum's `multiply(v, P)`
   value) and whose B is the value `Load`. `O_i` **stays a carrier channel** (so its seed + cross-tier machinery are
   untouched — the online-softmax ordering coupling is resolved by splicing the PV *inside* the generated merge, right
   before the O-fold, where `M`/`α`/`P` are already computed), only the value it folds is redirected. Both Q@K (on
   `source`) and P@V (in `partial`) are now `Contraction` nodes; `Reduction.loop` flattens both. At `block = 1` the `j`
   reduce is a singleton — the scalar streaming degenerate, **numerically identical** to the old inline `v·P` (proven:
   `test_scalar_flash_matches_torch` / `_dynamic_` / `_kv_tile_` / `_flash_chain_causal_and_gqa_` all green). Structure
   pinned by `test_flash_op_is_a_two_contraction_tree`. Chose **option (b)** but realized it *without* carrier-generator
   surgery: keeping `O_i` a carrier channel (not removing it) is what preserves the seed/cross-tier machinery while still
   de-fusing the ⊗ into a contraction.
3. ❌ **Layered mma — REVERTED. This is the deviation the mandate exists to prevent; the next attempt MUST NOT repeat
   it.** The landed version stamped the mma atom on both contractions (`_flash._chain_stamp`), had `_schedule` pass the
   mma-flash tree through **untouched** (an `is_mma_flash` bypass of the generic reduce/contraction fork), and had
   `factorize` **dispatch to a dedicated `lowering/kernel/_flash_warp.factorize_flash` single-warp emitter**. Two fatal
   violations: (i) a **fourth, kind-specific `factorize` path** — the exact "if a phase needs its own emitter, the node
   model is wrong" failure the invariant names; (ii) a **shape specialization** — `_chain_stamp` fired only when
   `_chain_eligible` (`head_dim % 16`, `d_v % 8`, static-seq %16) held. It was **deleted in full**: `_flash_warp.py`,
   the `is_mma_flash` / `_is_mma_flash` dispatch + bypass, and `_chain_atom` / `_chain_eligible` / `_chain_stamp`. The 26
   `test_generated_tensorcore_flash_*` + `test_warp_chain_*` e2e cases are **re-xfailed** (they assert the `dpl_mma…` /
   `flash_pv_smem` warp chain that no longer exists).

   **The correct rebuild (not yet done).** The two-`Contraction` flash tree is already the right *structure*. A
   tensor-core tier is: the Q@K and P@V `Contraction`s carry an mma `TilePlan` (a schedule field, stamped by
   `020_schedule` — no recognizer-side stamp, no shape gate outside the normal atom-eligibility the mma matmul tier
   already applies), and BOTH factorize through **the one `_bind` contraction arm** exactly like a standalone mma matmul. The
   only genuinely-new capability is the register-resident A operand (PV's `P` fragment): teach `_mma_reduce` to consume a
   computed-A `Body` (drop its `assert not a_computed`) so the C→A handoff is a *step inside the shared contraction
   pipeline*, not a private emitter. If that cannot be expressed as data on the node + the shared pipeline, the node
   model is still wrong — fix it; do not fork `factorize`.

**Decision (chosen): option (b)** — unify on the blocked form, scalar = its `block=1` degenerate, prove parity against
the non-xfailed scalar flash e2e. Steps 1–2 (the structural tree) stand; step 3 (the mma tier) is re-opened per above.

**THE CRUX — PV's A operand is register-resident, not a gmem `Load` (confirmed against the generated merge).** The exp
merge computes `P = exp(s − M)` (`m_i__t5`) and folds `O_i = O_i·α + v·P`. Making PV a real `Contraction` means its **A
operand is `P`** — the softmax probabilities, which live **in registers** (they are computed from the QK score
fragment), not in gmem. The `Contraction` node used to bake in **gmem `Load` operands** everywhere.

**✅ Register-resident A operand landed (this step).** `Contraction.a_load` is now `a_operand: Load | Body` — a gmem
`Load` **or** a computed `Body` producing `P` (its last def is the operand value). New node accessors: `a_body` (the
producing stmts — a singleton `(Load,)` for gmem, the body's stmts for computed), `a_computed`, `a_name`. The gmem path
is **byte-identical** (`a_body` for a `Load` is `(a_load,)`, so `contraction_loop`/`_synth_reduce` splice the same
single-stmt operand body). The **scalar tier** handles a computed A **for free**: the register-tile replication treats
`P = exp(S)` as ordinary K-loop body, so `for j: s=S[m,j]; p=exp(s); v=V[j,d]; oblk__v=v·p; oblk += oblk__v` factorizes
with no gmem A address. The **mma tier** (`_mma_reduce`) asserts `not a_computed` — the fragment-feed is step 3. Proven
by `test_contraction_computed_a_*` (standalone P@V: `O[m,d] = Σ_j exp(S[m,j])·V[j,d]`) in
`tests/compiler/ir/tile/test_structural_reduction.py`. `_atomize.bind_contraction` is unchanged — a computed-A
contraction is **constructed directly** (flash / tests), never recognized (recognition rejects pre-scaled operands), so
the binding path stays gmem-`Load`-only.

✅ **`_flash._flash_op` is the register-resident PV `Contraction` tree** (block=1 scalar).

✅ **Step 3 LANDED — tensor-core flash through the one emitter** (all 26 `test_generated_tensorcore_flash_*` /
`test_warp_chain_*` cases green: fp16/bf16 × plain/causal × static/dynamic-seq × GQA; every non-flash dump config
byte-identical). The sanctioned shape, no fourth path:

- **Schedule-side stamp** — `_schedule._twisted_warp_option`: a `TWISTED` exp-family streaming reduce whose partial is
  the contraction pair (a gmem-`Load` head + a computed-A expect) takes the warp tier when the mma atom is eligible
  (16-bit operand dtype; head-dim % atom_k; d_v % atom_n; static extents block-divisible — the symbolic path masks at
  the fragment instead). Both contractions get mma `TilePlan`s (per-node `tile`), the placement maps one warp per 16
  query rows (the value axis leaves the grid — it folds into the expect tile). The deterministic conservative pick,
  like `_pick_coop`; a `REDUCE` pin is the explicit scalar escape. No recognizer stamp, no `is_mma_flash` dispatch.
- **Fragment realization in the one binder** — `_bind`'s reduce arm keys on the structural warp-tile read
  (`_twist.warp_source`) and realizes the whole tree at FRAGMENT residence (`_twist.realize_warp_twist`): the head
  contraction emits `ldmatrix`/`mma.sync` off its node geometry; the score prologue realizes stmt-by-stmt (`Assign` →
  `FragmentApply`, coordinate `Select` → `FragmentMask` with the keep-predicate negated, loop-invariant constant
  `Load`s hoisted); the streaming merge is REGENERATED from the carrier's channel spec (pivot → `FragmentRowReduce`
  rowmax + running stats + α-rescale; denom → rowsum; the expect channel's ⊗ lift IS the P@V node, its
  register-resident A fed through the `flash_pv_smem` C→A smem handoff — the `Channel.lift` docstring's anticipated
  fragment realizer); the projection tail realizes as `FragmentApply(divide, ROW)` + `RegStore`. The kernel becomes
  warp-collective through the same `lanes` parameter `grid_tile` already takes. **This is deviation 4's fragment row
  landed with its first consumer** — the within-warp `__shfl` fold move, keyed on residence.
- **Kernel-IR restore** — the fragment family (`FragmentApply` / `FragmentRowReduce` / `FragmentMask`, `FragLayout` /
  `M16N8`) restored from the reverted commit; `FragmentApply` UNIFORM args now convert non-f32 scalars through the
  target intrinsic (the scalar `Assign` promote rule). Fixed en route: bf16 scalar constants materialized as ZERO bits
  (`cp.full` on the uint16-bits dtype) — `_materialize` now encodes bf16 constants with RNE.

Still xfailed: `test_attention_split_gpu.py` (cross-CTA flash split), `test_attention_coverage.py::
test_cooperative_flash_matches_torch` (the `BR` cooperative-KV scalar flash), and `test_flash_chain_matches_torch[*]`
(the `O[d]` register-vector scalar chain). The tensor-core cases are all recovered.

- **Symbolic-K masked mma edges** ✅ **landed.** The transposed-B symbolic-K guard is gone; two gmem-direct
  zero-fill helpers (`dpl_mma_load_b_gmem_trans_kzero` / `…_trans_nclamp_kzero`, the (n,k)-swapped mirror of the
  canonical-B ones) zero the masked-K tail, and the `LdmatrixLoad` renderer dispatches them off `b_trans`. Proven by
  `test_transposed_b_symbolic_k_zero_fills` (structure) + `test_masked_symbolic_accuracy[symbolic_k_trans-*]`
  (accuracy at straddling K = 16/31/130/512/700).

**Purge.**

- ✅ **Deleted the `raise LoweringError("warp tier: transposed-B symbolic-K mma not supported…")`** — landed with the
  masked path above.
- ✅ **`_flash.py` / `_atomize.py` docstrings describe the scalar-only reality** — with the warp chain reverted, the
  prose no longer references `_chain_stamp` / `_flash_warp` / `DEPLODOCK_CHAIN`; it states plainly that flash lowers on
  the scalar tier and a tensor-core tier is a matter of an mma `TilePlan` routed through the one `_bind` contraction arm, not a
  bespoke emitter. The scalar `ScalarAtom` / `TilePlan()` config stays (a real config of the scalar tier); the
  `_atomize` recursion seam is documented as unused (the flash tree carries its per-node geometry, so no recursive
  `bind_contraction` tree-walk).
- **Land the mma split-K auto-fork and delete the "pin-only" hedge.** `_schedule.schedule()` must emit unpinned `g<w>`
  candidates (`_splitk_specs` + occupancy gate); then strike "split-K stays pin-only" from the docs and flip the
  structural-fork search tests (`test_structural_push.py`, `test_two_level.py`, `test_resolve.py`,
  `test_diagnostics.py`). Sequence after the golden sweep re-validates (`tile_signature` parity).

### Phase 2 + 3 — operand staging (smem + `ldmatrix`) — ✅ LANDED (warp tier, together)

The plan sequenced Phase 2 (single-buffer `sync`) before Phase 3 (cp.async / TMA / ring / double-buffer), but every
recovery test pins a `cp` / `tma` transport, so the two phases landed together on the mma tier. `_stage.py` holds the
transport primitives (`cp_async_fill` / `cp_async_barrier` / `slab_smem` / `tma_*`); `_factor.py` holds
`_mma_stage_plan` (the TMA > cp.async > gmem-direct decision + `_can_stage_warp[_tma]` eligibility), the staged K-loop
(`_warp_staged_kloop` gmem→smem ring / `_warp_tma_staged_kloop`), and the shared inner drain
(`_staged_inner_atom_loop`, `reg_depth` register double-buffer). Threaded `factorize → _factorize_contraction →
reduce_codegen → _mma_state`/`_mma_reduce` off `TileOp.stage`. **Flipped:** `test_staged_matches_gmem_direct_bit_for_bit`,
`test_register_double_buffer_matches_single_buffer_bit_for_bit`, `test_cp_async_deep_ring_matches_gmem_direct_bit_for_bit`,
`test_bf16_operands_stage_via_cp_async`, `test_pinned_transport_and_shape_fire`, `test_masked_symbolic_m_structure`.

**Original Phase-2 plan (for reference).** Restore **single-buffer** staging: a `sync`-transport smem slab filled
cooperatively (a `__syncthreads` fill, no prefetch), operands read `ldmatrix`-from-smem. It splices into `reduce_codegen`
as a stage step **symmetric across both atoms** (mma: `ldmatrix` from smem; scalar: from the slab), driven off the
`Stage` on the node (`STAGE=d1/sync`). The stage is a wrapper on the K-loop's operand loads, **not** a second contraction
tier.

**Purge — the big "no divergent path" win.**

- **Subsume the fused-prologue shared-row staging into the general mechanism — ✅ LANDED (both steps).** The
  RMSNorm→linear prologue was a special-cased reduce-tier staging (`_factor.py`'s `_shared_row_buf` /
  `_has_contraction_tail` detection + `_restage_loads` rewrite). **Step 1:** its cooperative fill moved into the shared
  `_stage.py` module as `sync_row_fill` (the reduce tier's `sync` transport, the same linear-tid / thread-count seam as
  the warp tier's `cp_async_fill`). **Step 2:** the detection moved to the scheduler — `_schedule._row_stage` runs when
  a cooperative partition is chosen and stamps a depth-1 `sync` `Stage` whose `smem` names the row (the unmapped
  `TileOp` is seeded with the recognized `LoopOp`'s `inputs` so the scheduler can read operand shapes); `_bind_reduce`
  reads `ctx.stage` and only applies (fill + `_restage_loads`). Both tiers now share the same `Stage` → apply path;
  stamped on the schedule field only (never a knob), so `tile_signature` / featurization are untouched. Byte-identical.
- **Flip `TileOp.stage` from "dropped/reserved" to live** and strike "reserved" / "materialization dropped" from the
  knob table, `_factor.py`, `kernel/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `xfail_registry._STAGE` (delete `_STAGE` itself as its tests
  XPASS).

### Phase 3 — pipelining (cp.async ring / register double-buffer / TMA) — ✅ LANDED (with Phase 2)

Landed together with Phase 2 (see above) — the ring / double-buffer / TMA are all fields on the one `Stage`, decoded by
`_mma_stage_plan`. The remaining transport-renderer dead-code sweep (below) still applies.

**Build (reference).** Layer the depth/async variants on Phase 2's single-buffer stage, **all as fields on the same
`Stage`** — no new path:

- **cp.async ring** (`STAGE.depth>1`, `sm_80`) — prefetch the next K-chunk's fill over the current mma, a `depth`-slot
  ring.
- **smem→register double-buffer** (`STAGE.reg_depth` / `/p<n>`) — ping-pong `ldmatrix` over the inner atom-K steps
  (`STAGE.depth` = gmem→smem ring; `STAGE.reg_depth` = smem→register; `WarpTile.bk` = slab K-granularity, not a depth).
- **TMA** (`sm_90`, `cp.async.bulk.tensor` + mbarrier) — descriptor-driven bulk transfer; single-buffer then the ring.

Flips `test_cp_async_deep_ring_matches_gmem_direct_bit_for_bit`,
`test_register_double_buffer_matches_single_buffer_bit_for_bit`, `test_bf16_operands_stage_via_cp_async`,
`test_pinned_transport_and_shape_fire`, `test_knob_pinning.py::test_article_tma_sgemm_reproduction`.

**Purge.**

- **Collapse single-buffer into depth=1 of the ring — do not keep two emitters.** If Phase 2 produced a standalone
  single-buffer code path, `depth=1` must now be the ring with one slot; delete the standalone path. The transport
  (`sync` / `cp` / `tma`) is a parameter, not a branch of duplicated fill logic.
- **The kernel-IR transport vocabulary survived the demolition** (`cp.async`, TMA, mbarrier, the ring codec) — if any of
  it is now unreachable after wiring, delete the unreachable renderers rather than leaving them as museum pieces. Grep
  the kernel-IR for transport nodes with no producer.

### Scalar-tier operand staging — ✅ LANDED (`test_article_tma_sgemm_reproduction`, `test_sgemm_inner_reduce_is_unrolled`)

**Landed** exactly as the design below specifies: `_scalar_stage_plan` + `_scalar_staged_kloop` + `_scalar_drain` in
`_factor.py` (threaded `factorize → _factorize_contraction → reduce_codegen → _scalar_state`/`_scalar_reduce` off
`TileOp.stage` + `tile.inputs` for the slab dtype). The STAGE-pinned scalar contraction now stages its fp32 operands
through an smem slab (TMA `cp.async.bulk.tensor` box copy or cp.async), drained by a `#pragma-unroll`ed inner loop over
the derived K-chunk (bk=32 for the article tile), numerically exact (max-abs-err 0.0 vs numpy). The nested-accumulator
crux is solved with a **`Loop.seed` flag** (new field on `ir/stmt/blocks.Loop`): the inner drain is `seed=False` so it
does not re-declare the accumulators `_scalar_state` pre-seeds outside the outer slab loop. Masked M/N is supported (TMA
zero-fills the box overhang / cp.async clamps the gmem read; the drain indexes the slab by **local** tile coords so the
`% extent` wrap can't corrupt it, and the overhanging store is guarded). Gmem-direct is byte-identical (opt-in behind a
STAGE pin). `test_article_tma_sgemm_reproduction` was rewritten off the demolished `StageBundle` / `StagePolicy` API to
assert the scheduled scalar `TileOp` carries a TMA `Stage` + the kernel emits the box copy. **Remaining follow-ons:**
the cp.async gmem→smem ring (`depth ≥ 2` is single-buffer today) and the fp32 `analytic._enumerate` path (now
producible — the golden's staged fp32 signature can be enumerated; the fp16 golden still needs the warp-move catalog).

The scalar contraction tier was gmem-direct (`_scalar_state` / `_scalar_reduce` in `_factor.py` ignored `stage`). The
two xfailed SGEMM tests want the scalar tier to stage its fp32 operands through an smem slab (the article hero kernel:
`TILE=n32x8/f4x26`, `STAGE=d2/tma` → `cp.async.bulk.tensor` box copy + `#pragma unroll` inner reduce). This is a
**contained** build (scalar atom only; the mma path and the gmem-direct scalar baseline are untouched). Deep mapping
settled every constraint:

- **Gate for safety — gmem-direct stays byte-identical.** `_scalar_reduce` branches to the staged loop **only** when
  `stage is not None` AND `_scalar_stage_plan` returns eligible. `stage is None` (every current scalar matmul — no
  `STAGE` pin) takes the existing `_synth_reduce` path unchanged. So the whole build is opt-in behind a `STAGE` pin, and
  the green scalar-matmul e2e suite is the byte-identity guard.
- **Derive the scalar K-chunk — no codec change.** `TilePlan.bk` is mma-only (`1` for scalar) and the scalar `TILE`
  codec (`n<N>x<M>/f<fn>x<fm>`) has no `k<bk>` token; the tests pin no bk. So `_scalar_stage_plan` **derives** the slab
  K-chunk (`bk_elems`) to fit smem given `tile_m` / `tile_n` / dtype (a fit-to-48KiB pick, K divisible), avoiding any
  schema / featurizer / `tile_signature` / golden-signature change. Ineligible (symbolic / indivisible K, computed-A) →
  `"gmem"`, unchanged.
- **Reuse the fill; write only the scalar drain.** The fill is tier-agnostic: build a `CtaTile(row_base=m_b·tile_m,
  col_base=n_b·tile_n, linear_tid=<scalar unit-thread id from m_uvar/n_uvar>, n_threads=block_threads)` and call the
  **existing** `_stage.cp_async_fill` / `tma_fill` for the A `[tile_m × bk_elems]` and B `[bk_elems × tile_n]` slabs —
  the same primitives the warp tier uses. Only the **drain** is new: an inner K-loop over `bk_elems` whose cell FMAs read
  `a_slab[m − row_base, k − k0]` / `b_slab[k − k0, n − col_base]` instead of gmem (rewrite the `_synth_reduce` operand
  `Load`s' buffer+index; the `_scalar_cells` σ-replication + `_dedup_loads` are reused verbatim). Mark the inner loop
  `unroll` via the existing `_unroll_inner` (satisfies `test_sgemm_inner_reduce_is_unrolled`).
- **Structure** mirrors `_warp_staged_kloop`: outer K-slab `StridedLoop` (step `bk_elems`) { cooperative fill → barrier →
  inner drain loop → trailing `Sync` }; `depth ≥ 2` reuses the same ring prologue. TMA uses `tma_fill` + `tma_mbar_prologue`.
- **Test rewrite.** `test_article_tma_sgemm_reproduction` asserts on the **demolished** `StageBundle` / `StagePolicy`
  tile-body objects — rewrite it to the new model: drop the body-object assertions, keep the source assertion
  (`cp.async.bulk.tensor` emitted for the staged scalar tile). `test_sgemm_inner_reduce_is_unrolled` needs no rewrite
  (pure source check) — it passes once staging engages + the inner loop is unrolled.
- **The one hard sub-problem — accumulator lifetime across the nested loop.** Gmem-direct scalar seeds each cell's
  accumulator (`acc__c{i}_{j}`) *inside* the single `for k` loop (the dissolved fold `Accum` + `Loop.render` seed
  `acc = 0` at loop entry, fold inside). The staged form is **nested** — outer slab loop `for k0` { fill; inner
  `for ki` { fold } } — so the accumulators must be seeded **once, outside the outer loop** and folded across every slab
  without re-seeding. So `_scalar_state` (today `[]`) must, for the staged path, emit the per-cell accumulator
  `Init(acc=0)` seed decls, and the inner drain loop's `Accum` must fold into the pre-seeded acc (no re-seed). This is the
  scalar analogue of `_mma_state` declaring the `_c` fragments outside the mma K-loop. **Solution (traced):**
  `contraction_loop` seeds the acc via the Loop's *carrier* prelude (no explicit `Init`), so the staged form makes
  `_scalar_state` emit a per-cell `Init(name=f"{c.acc}__c{i}_{j}", identity=0)` for every cell (matching `_scalar_cells`'
  `copy_cell` suffix `__c{i}_{j}` exactly), and the inner drain is a **carrier-less** `Loop` (built like `_synth_reduce`
  but `role`/`carrier` unset and operand bodies reading the slabs) whose `Accum` folds into the pre-seeded acc — no
  re-seed. The slab operand loads index `a_slab[m_axis − row_base, ki]` / `b_slab[ki, n_axis − col_base]`; the existing
  `_scalar_cells` σ (which maps `m_axis` → `offset.base("m", i)`) rewrites them to `a_slab[local_row, ki]` automatically,
  so the drain reuses `_scalar_cells` + `_dedup_loads` verbatim. Add a `test_staged_scalar_matches_gmem_direct`
  bit-identity unit test alongside the article tests.
- **Verify:** scalar-matmul e2e stays byte-identical (gmem-direct untouched); the two tests flip; `make bench-kernels`
  spot-check on the article SGEMM shape. Then unblocks the fp32 `analytic._enumerate` path (the golden's `STAGE` signature
  becomes producible) — a follow-on, since the fp16 golden still needs the warp-move catalog.

### Phase 4 — warp specialization (`WarpSpec`)

**Build.** Heterogeneous warps: the CTA partitions into producer / mma / reducer roles wired by shared smem rings.
`WarpSpec` **delegates** — each `WarpRole` carries a sub-schedule that bottoms out in a uniform `Map` / `Reduction` /
`Contraction`, so warp-spec composes the *same three nodes*, never a fourth. The uniform `Stage` splits: the gmem→smem
*fill* becomes the shared `Channel`; each consumer's *local* register double-buffer stays on `role.stage`. `WarpSpec`
lives only at the top CTA level (`TileOp.workers`); roles do not nest.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Channel:                       # a shared smem ring — the producer/consumer seam
    name: str
    depth: int
    transport: str = "cp.async"      # cp.async | tma

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class WarpRole:                      # one warp group's job; its sub-schedule node NAMES the role
    stage_node: object               # the Map / Reduction / Contraction this role runs
    warps: int
    reads: tuple[str, ...] = ()
    writes: tuple[str, ...] = ()
    stage: Stage | None = None       # this role's LOCAL smem→register double-buffer

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class WarpSpec:
    place: Placement                 # the CTA-tile grid
    channels: tuple[Channel, ...] = ()
    roles: tuple[WarpRole, ...] = () # Σ role.warps = the CTA warp count
```

`WarpSpec` reuses the role vocabulary (`REDUCE` reducer / `WARP` mma / `STAGE` producer) and adds **role-namespacing**
(`mma:WARP=…` + the `CHANNEL` ring) — new grammar registered so `knob_features` / `apply_off_defaults` /
`tuning_knob_items` handle role-prefixed keys. Spelling: `CHANNEL=K:d3/cp;V:d3/cp mma:WARP=…/k2 reducer:REDUCE=b2
producer:STAGE=d3/cp`.

**Purge — tear down the rebuild scaffolding itself.**

- **`Channel` must not reimplement `Stage`'s transport.** If `Channel.depth` / `.transport` duplicate the ring logic
  Phase 3 built on `Stage`, factor the shared ring into one place and have `Channel` hold the *shared* variant only. One
  transport implementation, period.
- **Delete `TileOp.workers`'s "not yet built" language** and any `WarpSpec` placeholder / `None`-only handling once it
  is live.
- **When `XFAIL` reaches empty, demolish the recovery apparatus.** Delete `tests/xfail_registry.py`, the
  `pytest_collection_modifyitems` hook in `tests/conftest.py`, `TILE_ENTANGLED_FILES`, and unwrap every
  `try/except ModuleNotFoundError` guard around a tile import (the imports are unconditional now). **Then delete this
  plan** — a rebuild plan for a completed rebuild is the last shim.

## Sequencing & verification

```
Phase 0  purge residue    Schedule alias · Map.out/reduce_loop fallbacks · _with_reduce no-op · STAGE doc contradiction
   ▼
Phase 1  finish mma        tensor-core flash (Contraction mma atom + flash store sink) · symbolic-K masked edges
   │  purge → delete transposed-B-symbolic-K guard · flash "future work" scaffolding · split-K "pin-only" hedge
   ▼
Phase 2  staging           single-buffer smem + ldmatrix, symmetric across atoms (Stage on the node)
   │  purge → SUBSUME + delete the _shared_row_* prologue helpers · flip TileOp.stage live, delete _STAGE
   ▼
Phase 3  pipelining        cp.async ring · smem→reg double-buffer · TMA — fields on the same Stage

Consolidation  atom-as-descriptor: collapse the _mma_*/_scalar_* triples + the 2 staging drivers + _factorize_reduce +
   │            the inline scalar tier into ONE placement-keyed pipeline; `factorize` becomes a single call. Skeleton =
   │            _factorize_contraction + _tiling; deviations demolished per "The demolition" above. Steps: (2) descriptor
   ▼            + unify triples → (3) one Stage fill/drain → (4) placement-keyed fold move → (1) merge the reduce tiers.
Tensor-core flash  the reopened Phase-1 mma flash lands ON the collapse — its acceptance test (contract QK → fold
      softmax over the score fragment → contract PV → write, through the one pipeline). Then delete this plan.
```

- **Per phase:** delete the flipped xfail entries; `./venv/bin/pytest tests/compiler/e2e/ -p no:randomly -n auto
  --dist=loadgroup`; `make lint`. Staging / pipelining tests assert **bit-identity vs gmem-direct** — a stage must not
  change numerics. Guard the learned-prior featurization with a `tile_signature` invariance check (a phase adds a code
  but must not re-key existing kernels).
- **Purge gate (per phase):** grep proves the deletion is total — no surviving reference to the removed symbol, no
  docstring describing the removed fallback, no dead branch. A phase PR that adds capability without its purge is
  rejected.
- **Whole rebuild:** `make test` green with `XFAIL` empty and the registry deleted; no golden regression
  (`make bench-kernels` spot-check on a reduction + a matmul + a flash kernel).
