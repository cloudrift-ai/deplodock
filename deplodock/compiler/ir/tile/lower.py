"""Loop IR → Tile IR (naive — produces the high-level ``Block`` form).

Mechanical translation. Loop IR's leaves (``Load`` / ``Assign`` /
``Select`` / ``Write`` / ``Accum`` / ``Cond``) pass through unchanged.
Loop-IR ``Loop`` is rewritten to Tile-IR ``BoundLoop`` with
each ``BoundLoop`` carries a ``BoundAxis`` whose ``bind`` defaults to
``BIND_SERIAL`` (every thread walks the axis itself). Strategy passes
flip the bind on select ``BoundLoop``s to ``BIND_BLOCK_STRIDED`` to
express cooperative iteration.

**Outer free-Loop chain → ``Block.thread_axes``**. After stripping
leading non-Loop stmts (scalar Loads) into the TileOp body prefix,
lowering walks the outer free-Loop chain and strips it into a
``Block(thread_axes=...)`` (default: one thread per output point, the
correct shape for pointwise kernels and for reductions the cooperative
strategy chooses not to rewrite). Strategies that opt into cooperative
materialization move the axes from ``thread_axes`` to ``block_axes``.

The chain ends at: a level with multiple sibling stmts, a Loop with
``Accum`` in its immediate body (reduce — can't strip), or no Loop at
all.
