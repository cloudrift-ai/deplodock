"""High-level algebraic op tree — the geometry-free compute layer.

The algebraic vocabulary itself lives in :mod:`deplodock.compiler.ir.stmt.algebra` —
the lift :class:`~deplodock.compiler.ir.stmt.algebra.Map` (re-exported here), the fold
carrier ``Monoid`` (+ ``Twist``), and the contraction ``Semiring``. This module is the
**lowering** of that tree to loop IR (:func:`lower`) plus the structural pretty-printer.

A kernel's compute is a tree of three node kinds, each of whose children
(``Monoid.partial`` / ``Semiring.operands``) is itself one of the three:

- ``Map`` — a pointwise lift: a typed ``Body`` of loop-IR stmts (operand ``Load``\\ s, the
  lift ``Assign``\\ s, an optional masking ``Select``, and — at the kernel root — the
  output ``Write``) binding a value as its last def, optionally applied OVER a nested
  ``source`` node (``project ∘ reduce``). A bare operand load is a one-``Load`` ``Map``.
- ``Monoid`` — a fold over its ``axis`` through the carrier (its ``Twist`` is the
  combine), folding the ``partial`` sources. Flash is the ``(m, l, O)`` monoid whose
  score partial is a ``Map`` (or a nested ``Semiring``) and value partial a one-``Load``
  ``Map``; its ``O/l`` projection is a ``Map`` *over* the monoid.
- ``Semiring`` — a contraction ``reduce(⊕) ∘ map(⊗)`` (the matmul): the ``lift`` ⊗ over
  its ``operands``, folded by the additive ``fold`` ⊕ over ``reduce_axis``.

:func:`lower` emits loop-IR stmts: a ``Monoid`` generates an explicit ``Init`` per carried
state (``<f32> state = identity;``, via ``State.inits``) then the streaming ``Loop`` (its
partials expanded as sibling stmts + the carrier fold), and leaves an in-loop carrier with
its partials cleared. The ``Init`` stmts make the seed explicit IR so ``Loop.render`` stays
generic — it never reads ``state``. A ``Semiring`` generates its contraction ``Loop`` in
the matmul-recognizable ``Accum``-in-``Loop`` form; a ``Map`` emits its ``source``'s
lowering (if any) then its pointwise body. So a kernel *is* the lowered tree — no
per-kernel builder.
