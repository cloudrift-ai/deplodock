"""The geometry-free compute layer — the lift wrapper and its lowering.

A kernel's compute is a :class:`~deplodock.compiler.ir.tile.ir.Map` (re-exported here) — a
:class:`~deplodock.compiler.ir.stmt.body.Body` of loop-IR stmts holding the per-cell compute. A
reduction is a ``Map`` whose body contains the **annotated reduce ``Loop``** (its
:class:`~deplodock.compiler.ir.axis.AxisRole` + :class:`~deplodock.compiler.ir.stmt.algebra.Carrier`
stamped by recognition) followed by the post-reduce projection; a contraction is a ``Map`` whose
reduce ``Loop`` is ``CONTRACTION`` (the ``⊗`` lift sits in the loop body). The algebra is read
**structurally** off the annotated loop, never a stored node kind — the ``Monoid`` / ``Semiring``
node wrappers are retired.

This module is the thin lowering of that wrapper to loop IR (:func:`lower` — the body verbatim,
the carriers already dissolved into loose folds at recognition) plus the structural reads
(:func:`axis_role` / :func:`reduce_loop`) and the shared contraction-loop builder
(:func:`contraction_loop`)."""
