"""Materialize a ``TileOp``'s schedule into a ``KernelOp``.

Binds the schedule's grid axes to GPU threads and realizes the reduce partition. The step
dispatches on the kernel kind / its reduce plan:

- **Scalar tier** (``MapKernel``, or a reduction with a trivial ``ReducePlan``) — one
  thread per output cell. ``lower(op)`` emits the per-cell body (a serial reduce ``Loop``
  sits inside it, run by that one thread); the body is wrapped in a single :class:`Tile`
  (the linear-thread decode + bounds guard + per-axis index decode). A bare reduction's
  output ``Write`` is glue generated here from the schedule grid.

- **Cooperative tier** (a ``MonoidKernel`` whose ``ReducePlan`` carries a BLOCK stage) —
  one CTA per output cell, ``coop`` threads cooperatively folding the reduce axis. The
  serial reduce ``Loop`` becomes a :class:`StridedLoop` (each lane strides the reduce axis
  by ``coop`` from its lane index — the loop bound ``< extent`` masks the tail when ``coop``
  doesn't divide the extent), then the cross-thread combine
  (``_combine.emit_combine`` — derived ``WarpShuffle`` / ``TreeHalve``) merges the per-lane
  partials in place, then the projection / output ``Write`` runs guarded to lane 0. The
  ``Tile`` gains the cooperative lane axis (innermost) and ``block_threads = coop`` so the
  cuda lowering derives ``blockDim = coop`` / ``gridDim = output cells``.

The op tree + ``lower`` are shared across kinds; only the schedule's partition changes —
the article's "schedule separate from combine" thesis.
