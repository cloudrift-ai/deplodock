"""Form a ``TileOp`` from each ``LoopOp`` — decide launch geometry,
materialize post-lift coordination primitives.

Mechanical translation: outer free-Loop chain becomes ``Tile.axes``,
leaves and inner Loops pass through unchanged. The planner
(``000_partition_planner``) stamps Role tags on body Loops before
launch_geometry runs; this pass just reads the tags via
:func:`_bind_for_role` and lifts tagged Loops with the appropriate
``BoundAxis.bind``: ``Role.BLOCK`` and ``Role.SPLITK_BLOCK`` →
``BIND_BLOCK``; ``Role.THREAD`` and ``Role.COOPERATIVE_STRIDE`` →
``BIND_THREAD``; untagged Loops default to ``BIND_THREAD`` (safety net
for kernels the planner currently can't partition).

**Outer free-Loop chain → ``Tile.axes``**. After stripping leading
non-Loop stmts (scalar Loads) into the TileOp body prefix, the chain
walker descends single-stmt nests and lifts every Loop whose role
isn't body-resident (REGISTER / SERIAL_OUTER / STAGE_INNER / PIPELINE).
The chain ends at: a level with multiple sibling stmts, a reduce
Loop, a body-resident-role Loop, or no Loop at all.

**Body free Loops over output dims → ``Tile.axes``**. After the
outer chain is stripped, top-level body stmts may still contain free
Loops whose iteration writes distinct output positions (e.g. fused
SDPA's head-dim loop sits as a sibling to two softmax reduces). Each
such Loop is lifted into ``Tile.axes`` (bind resolved from its role,
defaulting to ``BIND_THREAD``) and replaced by its body.

**Post-lift coordination — generic.** Whenever a Loop is lifted to a
parallel coord (BIND_BLOCK or BIND_THREAD with COOPERATIVE_STRIDE),
every Write inside the lifted scope whose index doesn't reference the
lifted axis becomes potentially raced — multiple coords share an output
cell. The trigger check (``Write.index`` doesn't reference the axis) is
identical for both modes; the primitive that materializes the
coordination differs:

- **BIND_BLOCK** (cross-CTA): atomic-add Write, decomposing
  ``add(indep, dep)`` into ``atomic(dep) + Cond(axis == 0, atomic(indep))``.
  Subsumes the special-case SPLITK_BLOCK handling.
- **COOPERATIVE_STRIDE** (cross-thread): emit ``Combine`` siblings
  after each reduce subtree (smem tree-halve / warp-shuffle at
  materialize time), then ``Cond(axis == 0, [Write])``-wrap the Write.
  Post-Combine the broadcast value is uniform across the cooperative
  group, so no per-term decomposition is needed.

The node's id, inputs, and output tensor are preserved — only the op
changes.
