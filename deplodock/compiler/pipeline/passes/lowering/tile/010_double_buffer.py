"""Ping-pong double-buffering for K-outer staged matmul kernels.

For a Tile body shaped like ``Loop(K_outer, body=[Stage*, reduce])``,
this pass replaces each ``Stage`` with a ``BufferedStage`` carrying
``buffer_count = 2`` and a phase expression ``Var(K_outer_axis) % 2``.
The materializer then doubles the smem allocation and prepends the
phase to both the cooperative-load write and every body Load that
reads from the staged buffer.

The win comes from removing the leading ``__syncthreads`` between
prev-compute and next-load: with ping-pong, consecutive iterations
write to *different* physical smem regions, so the next iteration's
load can issue before the previous iteration's compute fully drains.
The trailing Sync (after the cooperative load, before compute reads)
is preserved.

Trigger:

- Tile body has exactly one ``Tile`` (the standard shape).
- The Tile body has a free Loop ``K_outer`` (extent ≥ 2) whose body
  contains ≥ 1 ``Stage`` and exactly one reduce ``Loop``.
- The reduce body has only ``Load`` / ``Assign`` / ``Accum`` stmts,
  defines ≥ 1 ``Accum``, and no body stmt reads any local Accum
  target's running value (rejects in-loop online-softmax-style merges
  where an Assign reads ``acc`` mid-iteration). ``register_tile`` no
  longer enforces this gate; ``014`` keeps it because its rewrite
  reorders smem visibility relative to the FMA chain and that
  reordering compounds fp32 drift on online-softmax-style bodies.
- Smem budget: ``2 × sum(slab_bytes) ≤ ctx.max_dynamic_smem`` — the
  per-block dynamic-smem opt-in cap derived from compute capability
  (99 KB on sm_86/89/120, 163 KB on sm_80, 227 KB on sm_90+).

Idempotence: a Stage that's already a ``BufferedStage`` is left alone.
