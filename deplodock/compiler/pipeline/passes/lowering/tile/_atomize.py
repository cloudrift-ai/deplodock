"""Atomize — resolve the algebra→hardware-atom binding structurally.

The warp matmul materializer needs to know which operand is the mma ``a`` vs ``b`` (by
axis-in-index), the fold accumulator, and the projection epilogue.
:func:`semiring_binding` reads them **structurally** off the lowered ``CONTRACTION`` reduce loop
— the operand ``Load``\\ s indexed over the K axis, the fold ``Accum`` target — and returns them as
the ``(a_load, b_load, acc, epilogue)`` facts that ``_schedule._contraction_node`` stamps onto the
:class:`~deplodock.compiler.ir.tile.ir.Contraction` structural node at fork-emit (the node
is then the single source of truth — it re-derives ``b_trans`` off ``b_load`` itself). Reading the
binding **structurally** off the annotated loop — not a stored node kind — is what keeps the ⊗/⊕
algebra a property of the loop, so no per-algebra op-tree node class is needed. The cooperative reduce
needs no binding here — its accumulator dtype + shuffle/tree
mechanism are derived at materialize time (``emit_combine`` off the carrier + ``ReduceStage.combine``).

**Called from ``020_schedule``, not a standalone pass.** The binding is resolved when the tiled
contraction leaf is built (``_warp_option`` / the tiled ``_tile_option``) — so an atom that
**cannot** be bound (e.g. a non-``Load`` operand: a computed-cone / demoted matmul) is rejected at
fork construction, alongside ``_check_warp_static_k``, instead of failing several passes later.
Leading ``_`` so the pass loader skips this module.

**Flash contractions are not recursively atomized.** Flash is a ``TWISTED`` kv
``Reduction`` over a ``Q@K`` :class:`~deplodock.compiler.ir.tile.ir.Contraction` ``source`` +
a ``P@V`` one in the ``partial``, lowered on the scalar tier (block=1) — each contraction carries a
scalar ``TilePlan()`` and factorizes through the one ``_factor`` contraction path. A tensor-core
flash tier would attach an mma ``TilePlan`` to those same nodes and route through that same path (no
bespoke emitter); ``bind_contraction`` stays loop-addressable (it binds the root contraction
structurally), and the recursive-atomize path is unused — the flash tree carries its per-node
geometry."""
