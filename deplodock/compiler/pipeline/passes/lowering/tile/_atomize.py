"""Atomize — resolve the algebra→hardware-atom binding structurally.

The warp matmul materializer needs to know which operand is the mma ``a`` vs ``b`` (by
axis-in-index), the fold accumulator, and the projection epilogue.
:func:`semiring_binding` reads them **structurally** off the lowered ``CONTRACTION`` reduce loop
— the operand ``Load``\\ s indexed over the K axis, the fold ``Accum`` target — and returns them as
the ``(a_load, b_load, acc, epilogue)`` facts that ``_schedule._contraction_node`` stamps onto the
:class:`~deplodock.compiler.ir.tile.ir.Contraction` structural node at fork-emit (the node
is then the single source of truth — it re-derives ``b_trans`` off ``b_load`` itself). Reading off
the annotated loop (not an op-tree node) is what let the ``Semiring`` / ``Monoid`` op-tree node
classes retire. The cooperative reduce needs no binding here — its accumulator dtype + shuffle/tree
mechanism are derived at materialize time (``emit_combine`` off the carrier + ``ReduceStage.combine``).

**Called from ``020_schedule``, not a standalone pass.** The binding is resolved when the tiled
contraction leaf is built (``_warp_option`` / the tiled ``_tile_option``) — so an atom that
**cannot** be bound (e.g. a non-``Load`` operand: a computed-cone / demoted matmul) is rejected at
fork construction, alongside ``_check_warp_static_k``, instead of failing several passes later.
Leading ``_`` so the pass loader skips this module.

**Recursion seam (deferred — warp-flash).** Flash is a ``TWISTED`` kv ``Loop`` (online-softmax)
over a nested ``CONTRACTION`` score ``Loop``, so a recursive atomize would bind the inner QK^T /
PV with the same :func:`bind_contraction` the root uses — that function is loop-addressable for
exactly this reuse. The inner score ``Loop`` IS now a structural ``CONTRACTION`` (built by
``ops.contraction_loop``, the same builder a standalone matmul uses), but it is **not wired yet**:
it carries no per-loop ``TilePlan`` / inner geometry, so a tree-walk would bind nothing. Wiring it
requires warp-flash to first attach that inner geometry; until then it is intentionally absent."""
