"""Partition planner — decide axis-structure splits up front.

Runs first in the Tile-IR lowering chain. Stamps ``Role`` tags on body Loops;
``001_launch_geometry`` and other downstream rules read the tags and skip
their own decisions.

Output axes split as ``A → A_b·(T·R) + A_t·R + A_r`` (T = BN or BM, R = FN or
FM). K splits as ``K → K_s·(K_o·br·bk) + K_o·(br·bk) + K_i·br + K_c`` (K_s for
SPLITK > 1, K_c for cooperative-K BR > 1). Resulting nesting:

    K_s BLOCK (split-K) → M_b BLOCK → N_b BLOCK → K_c THREAD (coop-K) →
      M_t THREAD → N_t THREAD → M_r REGISTER → N_r REGISTER →
        prelude → K_o SERIAL_OUTER → K_i STAGE_INNER (reduce σ(body)) →
        (helper-driven cross-thread combine when K_c is cooperative) →
        post-K tower → Write

Example transformation (matmul A[M=64,K=32] @ B[K=32,N=64] with BN=BM=16,
FM=FN=1, BK=16, SPLITK=1, BR=1):

    Input LoopOp body:

            for n in 0..64:
                Init(acc)

                    a = load A[m, k]; b = load B[k, n]
                    Accum(acc, a*b)
                Write(C[m, n], acc)

    Output (σ_outer rewrites m, n; σ_k rewrites k; tower wraps):

Warp-tier (MMA) variant — emitted by ``_build_split_body_warp`` when the
planner picks a :class:`WarpTileParams` row (only fires when
``DEPLODOCK_MMA=1`` and ``is_atom_eligible`` passes; see
``plans/mma-fragment-factorization.md``). The output-axis factorization
gains a WARP tier between BLOCK and REGISTER and an ATOM tier inside
REGISTER carrying the hardware cell shape:

    N → N_b·(W_n·F_n·A_n) + N_w·(F_n·A_n) + N_r·A_n + N_a
          BLOCK    WARP             REGISTER          ATOM

K stride per ``K_i`` step is the atom's K dim (e.g. 16 for
``wmma_m16n16k16_f16``) rather than 1 — each ``K_i`` iteration consumes
``atom_k`` K-elements via one ``mma.sync`` instruction.

Example (matmul A[M=128,K=128] @ B[K=128,N=128] with WN=WM=2, FM=FN=2,
BK=2, SPLITK=1, ATOM_KIND="wmma_m16n16k16_f16" → cell shape (16,16,16),
``F16`` operands, ``F32`` accumulator):

    Output (σ_outer maps m/n through 4 tiers; σ_k stride = atom_k = 16;
    M_a / N_a Vars stay OUT of σ — the fragment-lane offset is owned by
    the WMMA instruction, not the body indices):
        for m_b in 0..2 BLOCK:
            for n_b in 0..2 BLOCK:
                for m_w in 0..2 WARP:
                    for n_w in 0..2 WARP:
                        for m_r in 0..2 REGISTER:
                            for n_r in 0..2 REGISTER:
                                for m_a in 0..16 ATOM:    # structural marker;
                                    for n_a in 0..16 ATOM:    # absent from σ
                                        Init(acc)
                                        for k_o in 0..4 SERIAL_OUTER:
                                            for k_i in 0..2 STAGE_INNER reduce:
                                                a = load A[m_b·64 + m_w·32 + m_r·16, k_o·32 + k_i·16]
                                                b = load B[k_o·32 + k_i·16, n_b·64 + n_w·32 + n_r·16]
                                                Accum(acc, a*b)
                                        Write(C[m_b·64 + m_w·32 + m_r·16, n_b·64 + n_w·32 + n_r·16], acc)

The ``AtomTile(m_a, n_a)`` wrapper + its enclosed matmul-cell body
(``Init + K_o/K_i reduce + Write``) is consumed in the kernel pass
chain by ``kernel/005_lower_atom_tile``, which pattern-matches this
shape and rewrites it into an Mma* fragment chain
(``MmaFragment`` × 3 + ``MmaFill`` + per-K_i ``MmaLoad`` × 2 +
``MmaSync`` + final ``MmaStore``). The ``RegisterTile`` wrapper stays;
``kernel/010_split_register_axes`` replicates the Mma* chain per
``(m_r, n_r)`` cell, giving each cell its own fragment SSA names
(``c_frag_0_0`` / ``c_frag_0_1`` / …). After both kernel passes, the
``mma.sync`` instructions fire ``WM·WN·FM·FN·K_o·K_i = 64`` times per
CTA on this shape.

For cooperative-K reduce (e.g. sum K=512 with BR=256, BK=2), K_c appears as
a THREAD axis above the BLOCK level and σ_k extends to
``k = k_o·512 + k_i·256 + k_c``; the materializer emits the cross-thread
combine after the reduce subtree based on the escape-analysis helper
(``ir/tile/escape_analysis.py``) reading ``ThreadTile.cooperative_axes``.

For the fused-prologue matmul (SDPA P@V — softmax max/sum/reciprocal sitting
as siblings of an inner output Loop that holds the actual matmul), the chain
walker extends through the inner Loop (``_classify_fused_prologue``), stashes
the sibling reduces + assigns as ``KernelShape.prologue``, and the body builder
places the σ-rewritten prologue inside the ``M_r`` REGISTER scope but outside
the ``N_r`` register tower. SPLITK clamps to 1 in this branch — the prologue
feeds the matmul, so each K_s CTA would consume a partial softmax stat.

Pointwise collapses to BM = FM = FN = 1; extent-1 sub-axes get inlined by
normalize_body. SPLITK + Write atomicity is derived at codegen time from
``escape_analysis.atomic_axes`` (Write index vs enclosing block axes).
Cooperative-K combine emission similarly happens in the materializer from
the helper's ``accum_cooperative_axes``.

Priority keys: matmul prefers high cells/thread (amortize K-loop overhead);
pointwise prefers low cells/thread (memory-bandwidth bound); cooperative
reduce prefers warp-sized-or-larger BR. All target ~256 threads/CTA.
