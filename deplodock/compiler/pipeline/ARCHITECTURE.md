## Engine (`engine.py`)

### Chain matcher

A `Pattern(name, op_type, constraints={})` matches one node by op type
plus optional `node.op` field equality. A pattern list matches a chain:
the seed matches `pattern[0]`, its sole consumer matches `pattern[1]`,
and so on. Multi-node patterns only fire when each intermediate node
has exactly one consumer.

`match_pattern(graph, pattern) → list[Match]` walks every topo-ordered
seed; overlaps between matches are allowed (the rewriter exits after
the first successful rewrite per iteration so overlap is just
candidate enumeration).

`Match.nodes: dict[str, Node]` maps each pattern entry's name to the
matched `Node`. `Match.consumed` and `Match.output` are overridable by
the rewrite function to control which nodes the splicer removes and
which node's edges get rewired.

### Rule module convention

Every file named `NNN_<name>.py` under a pass directory is a rule:

```python
PATTERN = [Pattern("root", SomeOp), ...]   # required
def rewrite(ctx: Context, graph: Graph, match: Match) -> Graph | Op | list[Graph | Op]:
    ...
```

The dispatcher binds parameters by name. Reserved names: `graph`,
`match`, `root`, `out`, `ctx`. Pattern names from `PATTERN` bind to
matched `Node` objects. Anything else binds positionally to
`root.inputs[i]`. Take only what you need — `ctx` is optional.

**Returning a list = autotune fork.** A rule that's unsure which
parameter to use returns the alternatives as a list. The engine applies
option 0 inline and pushes one `Candidate` per remaining option onto the
search queue (deep-copying the graph at the fork point). Single-option
returns (or bare `Graph` / `Op`) are the deterministic case — no fork.

**Idempotence requirement.** Every rule MUST be idempotent on its own
output. The engine re-runs the entire pipeline on each popped candidate
from pass 0; rules whose output is already in the graph must `RuleSkipped`
or have a pattern that no longer matches. Most rules satisfy this
implicitly via op-type changes (`LoopOp` → `TileOp`); the rest have
explicit `raise RuleSkipped("already X")` guards. Without idempotence,
re-runs would double-apply and corrupt graph state.

The return type discriminates the rewrite flavor:

- **Functional** — returns a `Graph` fragment, spliced in place of
  `match.output` (defaults to `match.root_node_id`); fragment `InputOp`
  nodes reference existing graph nodes by id, non-Input nodes get fresh
  ids.
- **In-place** — returns an `Op`. The engine assigns it to `root.op`
  directly, preserving the node id, inputs list, output Tensor, and
  hints. Used by the lowering rules because `KernelOp.arg_order` /
  `CudaOp.arg_order` embed the original node id as the output buffer
  name, so a fresh id from splicing would break the generated kernel's
  buffer binding.

Raise `RuleSkipped(reason)` to decline a match — the engine logs the
reason at DEBUG and moves on.

Files starting with `_` (e.g. `_broadcast.py`) are **not** loaded as
rules — they're shared helpers for the pass's rule modules.

### Drivers

`Pipeline.build(passes)` wraps a pass list; the resulting object exposes
three entry points:

- `Pipeline.run(graph, *, backend=None, db=None) -> Graph` — single-shot
  compile via `GreedySearch`. Stops at the first terminal candidate.
- `Pipeline.tune(graph, *, search, backend=None, db=None) -> Iterator[Candidate]` —
  autotune sweep. Pass a `TuningSearch(patience=, ucb_c=)`; the iterator
  yields one terminal `Candidate` per fully-explored rollout.
  `Pipeline.tune` benches each terminal via `_bench_terminal` (writes
  per-kernel `perf` / `lowering` / inventory rows, returns the aggregate
  `PerfStats`), then calls `search.observe(stats, status)`. With
  `backend=None` the bench is stubbed to `latency_us=1.0`.
- `Pipeline.search(search, ctx, *, db=None) -> Iterator[Candidate]` — the
  inner engine loop both wrappers drive. Pops a `LazyCandidate`,
  resolves it, runs one rule batch, pushes successors. At fork points,
  if `db` is provided, looks up the best-known child for the parent
  op's `op_cache_key` in `lowering` and passes the matching fork via
  `search.push(..., best=...)`. Greedy uses `best` when present;
  tuning ignores it.

### Search persistence: on-disk inventory vs in-memory MCTS

The autotune state is split across two cooperating modules:

- **`SearchDB`** (`search/db.py`) — SQLite store partitioned into six
  tables: `loop_op`, `tile_op`, `kernel_op`, `cuda_op` (one row per op
  encountered along any lowering chain, keyed by `op_cache_key`), a
  `lowering` edge table (one row per rewrite hop carrying the knob
  delta the rule stamped at that hop plus a best-median upsert, so
  `GreedySearch` can replay the chain by matching forks against the
  delta at each step), and a backend-partitioned `perf` table carrying
  full stats (`latency_us_{median,min,max,mean,variance}`,
  `n_samples`, `backend`, `status`, `knobs`). Selection statistic is
  the median.
- **`SearchTree`** (`search/policy/mcts.py`) — pure-Python in-memory
  MCTS state, colocated with `TuningSearch` because MCTS is the only
  policy that reads it. Each tree node wraps a `LazyCandidate`; nodes
  carry `visits` and `best_reward` (max reward over the subtree's
  measured leaves), plus a `live` counter that filters out subtrees
  whose frontier has been fully drained. Tree built from push lineage
  (parent of a pushed node = the most recently popped node). Rebuilt
  fresh each process; cached `perf` rows in the DB ensure no re-bench
  on warm starts. `GreedySearch` has no tree.

`Pipeline._bench_terminal` is the only function that knows about all
four parts (graph, DB, tree-through-`search.observe`, backend). It
short-circuits when every `CudaOp` in the graph already has a `perf`
row for the current `(context_key, backend)` — no GPU bench, stats
reconstructed from the DB. Otherwise it does one
`backend.benchmark(...)` call, walks `Op.source` once to record op
inventory + lowering edges + the `perf` row per kernel, and returns
the aggregate `PerfStats` (summed across kernels) for the search to
score.

## Pass directories

Pass files are numerically prefixed so `sorted()` pickup is
deterministic. Pick a fresh prefix when adding a rule; the pass loader
ignores the prefix itself — it's only for ordering readability.

| Pass                       | What rules do                                                        |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `frontend/decomposition/`  | Rewrite frontend ops (`LinearOp`, `MatmulOp`, `SdpaOp`, layout ops, fused ops like `rms_norm`/`softmax`) into tensor-IR primitives + layout-only `IndexMapOp`s. Each rule emits broadcast-explicit IR via `_broadcast.broadcast_to`. |
| `frontend/optimization/`   | `compose_indexmaps`: collapse chains of single-source / single-consumer `IndexMapOp` into one coord_map — prevents trivial layout kernels from blocking fusion. |
| `loop/lifting/`            | `lift_*` rules wrap each surviving tensor primitive (elementwise / reduce / indexmap / gather) in a trivial one-op `LoopOp`. |
| `loop/fusion/`             | `merge_loop_ops` splices adjacent `LoopOp` pairs using `ir/loop/splicer.py::splice_graph`. |
| `lowering/tile/`           | `tileify` produces a `TileOp` per `LoopOp` (strips the outer free-Loop chain into `Tile.thread_axes` and lifts inner output-write free Loops); follow-up rules annotate scheduling decisions on the `Tile` (block/thread bindings, `Stage` nodes, `Combine`). Order: `chunk_matmul_k` → `split_matmul_k` → `cooperative_reduce` → `blockify_launch` → `chunk_reduce` → `stage_inputs` → `register_tile` → `double_buffer` → `tma_copy` → `split_inner_for_swizzle` → `async_copy` → `pad_smem` → `pipeline_k_outer` → `mark_unroll`. `chunk_reduce` chunks non-matmul reduces (softmax, SDPA-reduce, RMSNorm) whose post-blockify candidate slab would exceed `stage_inputs`'s 16 KB cap — fires only when chunking would actually unblock staging. Staging runs before register tiling so the classifier sees clean PAT × PAT threads; `register_tile` keeps Stages singleton across F² (only consumer Loads multiply); `double_buffer` promotes K-outer Stages to `BufferedStage` (cross-loop SSA reads are allowed when they resolve to scope-level invariant names — e.g. SDPA's per-output reduce reading prior softmax `acc0` / hoisted `reciprocal(acc1)` — so all three SDPA-reduce reduces double-buffer + TMA on sm_90+); `tma_copy` narrows eligible BufferedStages to `TmaBufferedStage` (cp.async.bulk.tensor transport, sm_90+); `async_copy` narrows the rest to `AsyncBufferedStage` (cp.async transport, sm_80+); `pad_smem` adds `Stage.pad` to break smem bank conflicts (skips `TmaBufferedStage` — TMA uses its own swizzling); `pipeline_k_outer` rotates the K-outer loop into prologue + steady-state + epilogue with `AsyncWait` placement. |
| `lowering/kernel/`         | `materialize_tile` consumes scheduling decisions and emits hardware primitives (`Smem`, `Sync`, `TreeHalve`, `StridedLoop`), mutating the node's op to `KernelOp` in place. |
| `lowering/cuda/`           | `lower_kernelop` renders the `KernelOp` body to a `__global__` source string (via `ir/kernel/render.py::render_kernelop`) and mutates the node's op to `CudaOp` in place. |

See `ir/ARCHITECTURE.md` for what each IR dialect looks like.

## Dump hooks (`dump.py`)

`CompilerDump.on_pass(idx, pass_name, graph)` dumps the post-pass graph
uniformly for every pass: `NN_<pass_name>.{json,txt,dot}` (+
`NN_<pass_name>.kernels.txt` if any node has a non-empty
`pretty_body()`). Slashes in the pass name are flattened to
underscores, so `lowering/cuda` dumps as e.g. `06_lowering_cuda.*`. The
pre-pipeline input graph is dumped separately as `00_input.*` via
`dump.dump_input_graph(graph)` from the caller.

The uniform strategy means adding a new pass automatically gets dumped
— no per-pass registration needed. Rendering the kernel-level IRs
(loop/tile/kernel/cuda) lives in `format_kernels(graph)`, which calls
each op's own `pretty_body()`. Node ids accumulate `merged_` per
fusion step and a leading `lift_` from lifting; `_canonical_node_id`
collapses both for display, and the rendered body is rewritten with
the same map so `Load`/`Write` references match.

## Per-rule diff output (`rule_diff.py`)

At `compile -vv` (DEBUG log level) the engine emits one block per rule application: a unified diff between the
matched subgraph before the rewrite and the rewritten fragment, bracketed by `>>> <pass>:NNN_rulename` and
`<<< <pass>:NNN_rulename` markers on their own lines. The `<pass>` prefix is the single-letter shorthand from
`PASS_SHORTHAND` (`d`=decomposition, `o`=optimization, `l`=lifting, `f`=fusion, `t`=tile, `k`=kernel, `c`=cuda) —
the same letters the CLI accepts in `--passes dolft`. Skipped rules (`RuleSkipped` exception) collapse to a
one-liner `--- <pass>:NNN_rulename skipped at <root>: <reason>`.

`PASS_SHORTHAND` is the single source of truth: `commands/compile.py` imports it to build its `--passes` shortcut
expander, so the CLI flag and the `-vv` marker prefix can never drift.

The bracketing makes per-rule and per-pass slicing trivial — `awk '/^>>> t:005/,/^<<< t:005/'` extracts a
single rule's diff and `awk '/^>>> t:/,/^<<< t:/'` extracts the entire tile-lowering pass. ANSI color (`+` green, `-` red, `@@` cyan) is applied only inside the diff body, so the markers
stay plain ASCII and `awk` matches reliably even on colored output. Color follows
`compile --color {auto,always,never}` (default `auto`: tty-aware, honors `NO_COLOR`); diff context and a
fallback line cap are tuned via `--diff-context N` and `--diff-max-lines N`. `RuleRenderConfig` is set once from
`commands/compile.py:handle_compile` via `rule_diff.set_config()`.

The structured `.rules.json` dump under `DEPLODOCK_DUMP_DIR` is unaffected — the diff is purely a presentation
layer for the human-readable `_rule_texts` channel.

## Fragment splice (`engine._apply_replacement`)

1. Walk the fragment in topo order. `InputOp` nodes forward their id to
   the existing graph node (external reference); non-Input nodes are
   added to the graph with fresh ids.
2. `replace_node(match.output or match.root_node_id, new_output)`
   rewires all consumers (and `graph.outputs` slots) from the old
   output to the fragment's output id.
3. Merge hints from every consumed node into the new output.
4. Remove consumed nodes and run `_remove_orphans` to drop any now-
   dangling constants/inputs.

## Invariants

- A rule module must not reach into the engine's internals; its
  interface is `PATTERN` + `rewrite(graph, match)`.
- `pipeline/` imports from `ir/` but never from `backend/`. Lowering
  rules produce IR; actually executing that IR is the backend's job.
