## Engine (`engine.py`)

### Chain matcher

A `Pattern(name, op_type, constraints={})` matches one node by op type
plus optional `node.op` field equality. A pattern list matches a chain:
the seed matches `pattern[0]`, its sole consumer matches `pattern[1]`,
and so on. Multi-node patterns only fire when each intermediate node
has exactly one consumer.

`match_pattern(graph, pattern) → list[Match]` walks every topo-ordered
seed; overlaps between matches are allowed (the rewriter exits after
the first successful rewrite per iteration so overlap is just
candidate enumeration).

`Match.nodes: dict[str, Node]` maps each pattern entry's name to the
matched `Node`. `Match.consumed` and `Match.output` are overridable by
the rewrite function to control which nodes the splicer removes and
which node's edges get rewired.

### Rule module convention

Every file named `NNN_<name>.py` under a pass directory is a rule:

```python
PATTERN = [Pattern("root", SomeOp), ...]   # required
def rewrite(ctx: Context, graph: Graph, match: Match) -> Graph | Op | list[Graph | Op]:
    ...
```

The dispatcher binds parameters by name. Reserved names: `graph`,
`match`, `root`, `out`, `ctx`. Pattern names from `PATTERN` bind to
matched `Node` objects. Anything else binds positionally to
`root.inputs[i]`. Take only what you need — `ctx` is optional.

**Returning a list = autotune fork.** A rule that's unsure which parameter to use returns the
alternatives as a list, in any order — the engine spawns one `LazyCandidate` per option (sharing the
parent's graph snapshot) and hands them ALL to the single `TuningSearch` policy, which ranks them by PUCT over
its learned `CatBoostPrior` (`search/prior/`). A single-shot compile has no prior → uniform PUCT → it keeps
the first (option-0) sibling; a `tune` sweep explores every fork. (DB-best replay `_best_fork`, the static
`score_of` prior, and `GreedySearch` were all removed.) Single-option returns (or bare `Graph` / `Op`)
are the deterministic case — no fork.

**Lazy hierarchical forks via `Fork`.** `Fork` is an interface (`pipeline/fork.py`): `knobs` (the knob delta
the fork pins), `is_leaf`, `expand()` (the next level of options — more Forks, concrete `Op`/`Graph`
leaves, or a mix; exactly `[option]` for a leaf), and `score(cache)` (the lazy planner prior — see below).
The search loop pops a Fork-pending `LazyCandidate`, invokes `expand()` to materialize the children,
pushes them back, and continues; cursor advance only fires when the lineage resolves to a concrete leaf.
Lets a rule expose a hierarchy of decisions lazily — only the subtrees the search actually walks into get
materialized. `Fork.knobs` is the knob delta a fork pins — the variant identity the perf DB keys on — read
without expanding.
Implementations hold their producer's state as data: `OptionFork` (a concrete `Op`/`Graph` leaf, built by
`LazyCandidate.from_option`), `ThunkFork` (generic flat forks — `expand_fn(knobs)` /
`score_fn(knobs)` functions of the fork's own knob delta, so siblings share one function instead of
per-instance capture lambdas; used by `085_warp_specialize`), and the tree builder's branch / leaf node
classes.

**The planner score compute (no longer drives selection).** The static prior was nuked from selection in
favor of the learned prior (`CatBoostPrior`); `Search.score_of(fork) = fork.score(self.score_cache)` is retained as
latent compute (exercised directly by the partition-planner tests). It still keys cleanly: the search owns
the value-keyed score cache, and the partition planner keys each variant by `(ctx fields, frozenset(merged
knobs))`, complete because the `S_*` structural-feature knobs ride the dict, so structurally identical
kernels share every score. The same `S_*` features are what the learned prior featurizes (`knob.knob_features`).

The partition planner (`lowering/tile/010_partition_loops`) emits one
hierarchical Fork tree over both tiers:
`MMA → BR → (BM,BN) → (WM,WN) → (FM,FN) → TileOp` leaf — each leaf carrying its COMPLETE knob row
(incl. `BK` / `SPLITK` / `FK` / `OVERHANG`, which live in no level), the DB-matchable variant identity. The root
`MMA` level keys warp rows by atom kind; scalar rows return an empty key and skip the level (their subtree
splices up as siblings of the atom branches — no `MMA` knob ever pins a scalar path), and the builder's
single-value collapse erases tier-foreign levels (warp rows carry `br = bm = bn = 1`, scalar rows
`wm = wn = 1`), so a pure-scalar kernel's tree is exactly the classic
`BR → (BM,BN) → (FM,FN)` over full-row leaves. Warp-vs-scalar ranking is score-driven; an explicit
`DEPLODOCK_MMA=<kind>` pin is authoritative (the planner drops the scalar tier so score can't sidestep it).
The per-variant prior is `TileOp.lazy_score(ctx, knobs=..., shapes=...)` — a pure formula over cheap
inputs (the variant's stamped knob dict + planner shape) so siblings rank without anyone instantiating a
TileOp. The branch tree's `score()` propagates max from leaves, matching MCTS's max-Q semantics.

Binding tiers the planner emits today: `Role.BLOCK` (→ `GridTile`),
`Role.THREAD` (→ `ThreadTile`), `Role.REGISTER` (→ `RegisterTile`).
`Role.WARP` (→ `WarpTile`) and `Role.ATOM` (→ `AtomTile`, the
hardware-atomic MMA cell tier) are wired through `_layer_kind_for` /
`_wrap_tower` but no rule in this pass emits either today — the MMA
fragment-factorization consumer plan (`plans/mma-fragment-factorization.md`)
will flip these tiers when its M3 ships, without revisiting the tower
mechanics. M1 of that plan landed the `AtomTile` flavor + the (then-empty)
atom registry — now `ir/tile/ir.py`'s `ATOM_REGISTRY` — + the warp-tier variant row in `_enumeration`
(a plain knob dict like every row: warp tier carries `{WN, WM, FM, FN, BK, SPLITK, MMA}` and is
discriminated by the `MMA` key; the `Atom` spec is `ATOM_REGISTRY[row["MMA"]]`). `085_warp_specialize` already emits `WarpTile(role)` (one
role axis = total CTA warps) wrapping `WarpSpecialize` directly,
bypassing the planner's tower builder — its role split is structural
(`Cond(role < n_producer_warps, …)`), not the σ-shifted extended
`ThreadTile` the pre-refactor shape used. The materializer drops a
`ThreadTile(tid_offset=n_producer_threads, …)` inside the consumer
branch so the original consumer thread axes decode against
`threadIdx.x - n_producer_threads`. The pass handles **both** consumer
tiers: a scalar `ThreadTile` (pointwise / cooperative-reduce) and the
warp-tier MMA tower's existing `WarpTile` (WM×WN warp coords). For the
warp tier it consumes the planner-emitted `WarpTile` directly — no fresh
tier synthesis — and stamps `WarpSpecialize.consumer_is_warp=True`, so the
materializer wraps the consumer in a `WarpTile(tid_offset)` decode
(`warp_id = (threadIdx.x − n_producer_threads) / 32`) and scales every
consumer `bar.sync` participant count by 32 (warp axes count warps, not
threads). `005_lower_atom_tile` harvests the producer body's hoisted
`StageBundle` Sources before lowering the consumer `AtomTile` so the MMA
Loads resolve their smem addressing across the producer/consumer split.
Validated `max_diff=0` across 256²–2048²; ~no latency change vs WS=0 on
GeForce s16816 (its cuBLAS gap is the SASS mma schedule below the IR, not
producer/consumer overlap), so the autotuner normally picks WS=0 — the warp
arm is for parity / investigation and Hopper-class parts.

The tree-building algorithm itself (group params by per-level knob keys, collapse single-key levels, skip
empty-key levels, defer leaf materialization to `expand()`) lives in `pipeline/fork.py` (next to the
`Fork` interface and its flat implementations) as the
reusable `Level` + `build_fork_tree` pair — `partition_loops` supplies the `Level`s + `materialize=` +
`score=` callables and returns the result. Nodes are real classes holding data, not closures: every
`_Branch` / `_Leaf` references one shared `_Tree` (levels + callables). The
builder hands back the lazy ROOT `_Branch` and nothing else exists yet: a branch's `expand()` builds its
children on demand (in grouping order — ranking is the search's job), its `score(cache)` takes `max` over
the per-param scores of its subgroup (provably the same max-propagation as an eager build, without
instantiating the subtree), and the per-param scorer — `score(p, cache)`, which receives the search-owned
value-keyed cache and owns its own keying — fires only when a score is actually read; the builder adds no
caching of its own. Future rules with multi-level knob-cartesian forks should reuse the builder; one-shot flat
forks (e.g. `lowering/tile/085_warp_specialize`'s `WS={0,1}` 2-element `ThunkFork` list) stay inline.

**FN > 1 lowering.** The partition planner always emits the per-cell
shape — one `RegisterTile(N_r)` wrapping the whole
`{Init, K-reduce, Write}` body, regardless of FN / SPLITK / BR / prologue
shape:

    M_r REGISTER:
      RegisterTile(N_r):
        Init(acc)
        K_o SERIAL_OUTER:
          K_i STAGE_INNER (reduce):
            <body>                               # M-axis Loads, prologue,
                                                 # Load b, Accum — replicated
                                                 # per cell by the Kernel-IR
                                                 # replicator
        Write(C, acc)

The Kernel-IR replicator (`lowering/kernel/010_split_register_axes`)
walks the body and per-cell duplicates only statements that transitively
depend on the register axis (dep-tracked via Expr free vars + SSA
def-use); N-invariant statements (e.g. Load `a[m, k]`, the RMSNorm
prologue chain) stay single-copy. `dedup_replicated`
(`lowering/kernel/011_dedup_replicated`) then runs as content-agnostic
defense in depth: structurally identical Loads and Assigns left over
after replication CSE-fold into one — the same effect the deleted
register-blocked GEMM builder used to get from its hand-written
N-invariant-cone partition (see `plans/obsolete-blocked-gemm-builder.md`).

Leaf Fork `expand` thunks call `_materialize(plan, params)` lazily —
`_build_split_body` + `TileOp.__post_init__` (which runs the full
12-pass `normalize_body`) only fire for the variant the search actually
resolves. In greedy `deplodock compile`, that's one variant per LoopOp. The enumeration is large — the
widened FM/FN candidate set yields ~40k+ knob rows per matmul-class kernel (not the "couple hundred" the
original lazy split assumed) — so the finished `_Plan` rides its LoopOp as op metadata
(`loop_op.meta["plan"] = (cache_key, plan)`): ops are shared by reference across graph copies and
`single_node_graph` tune slices, so re-planning the same op object short-circuits entirely (classification
and enumeration included). The stamp is validated against `_plan_cache_key` — the carry-forward knobs,
which include the `S_*` structural features stamped by `loop/fusion/992_stamp_structural_features` (a stmt/op
histogram + loop extents + operand dtypes, so a structure or dtype change is an identity change), + the
hardware context + the live `DEPLODOCK_<KNOB>` pin snapshot (pins fold into enumeration via `Knob.narrow`)
— so a pin / ctx / structure change invalidates it. The `S_*` knobs also power the search-owned
value-keyed score cache (see "Scoring is search policy" above): `_score_variant` keys each variant by
`(ctx fields, frozenset(merged knobs))`, complete because the `S_*` features ride the knob dict, so
structurally identical kernels — the same layer repeated through a whole model — share every score with no
object-identity bookkeeping, and entries can never go stale because the score is a pure function of the key.

For rules that want a custom scorer, override
`Op.lazy_score(cls, ctx, *, knobs=None, shapes=None)` on the producing Op class. The base implementation
returns `None` (no prior available). This is the ONLY scorer — there is deliberately no
post-materialization `Op.score`; every ranking decision flows through the same cheap (knobs, shapes)
formula, so an op never needs to exist just to be ranked (the old eager walk also contributed nothing to
search decisions: fork siblings share their `inner` snapshot by reference and UCB only compares children of
one parent, so an inner-graph term was a constant offset within every comparison set). `TileOp.lazy_score`
is the reference implementation — it consumes `KernelShape` + the variant's stamped knob dict (the
planner's `_variant_knobs` builds the exact dict `_materialize` stamps; any knob source — DB rows, golden
configs, pin sets — is scoreable, and via `_materialize` buildable, as-is) and computes
`score_tile_geometry` on the launch-geometry + cells + coalescing keys, with the smem-fit penalty's
input-buffer count derived from `KernelShape` (walking `outer_m` / `extra_outer` / `prologue` for distinct
`Load.input`).

**Idempotence requirement.** Every rule MUST be idempotent on its own
output. The engine re-runs the entire pipeline on each popped candidate
from pass 0; rules whose output is already in the graph must `RuleSkipped`
or have a pattern that no longer matches. Most rules satisfy this
implicitly via op-type changes (`LoopOp` → `TileOp`); the rest have
explicit `raise RuleSkipped("already X")` guards. Without idempotence,
re-runs would double-apply and corrupt graph state.

The return type discriminates the rewrite flavor:

- **Functional** — returns a `Graph` fragment, spliced in place of
  `match.output` (defaults to `match.root_node_id`); fragment `InputOp`
  nodes reference existing graph nodes by id, non-Input nodes get fresh
  ids.
- **In-place** — returns an `Op`. The engine assigns it to `root.op`
  directly, preserving the node id, inputs list, output Tensor, and
  hints. Used by the lowering rules because `KernelOp.arg_order` /
  `CudaOp.arg_order` embed the original node id as the output buffer
  name, so a fresh id from splicing would break the generated kernel's
  buffer binding.

Raise `RuleSkipped(reason)` to decline a match — the engine logs the
reason at DEBUG and moves on.

A rewrite that *returns* an op which fails `Op.validate(ctx)` (e.g. a
`100_materialize_tile` `KernelOp` whose smem exceeds `ctx.max_dynamic_smem`)
is filtered by `Candidate.try_rewrite` — correct as **fork pruning** (sibling
branches carry other tile shapes) but fatal in a single-path greedy compile,
where it leaves the node un-lowered. `Pipeline.run` installs a `rejections` sink on the
`Run` that records each such drop `(node, pass, reason)`;
after the terminal settles, `_raise_on_unlowered` raises a loud `LoweringError`
naming any still-un-lowered node (its op is still a `LoopOp`/`TileOp`) instead
of letting it leak to `CudaBackend` as a cryptic `non-CudaOp` `TypeError`. The
sink is absent under `tune`, so the fork-pruning path stays silent and a
validate-dropped branch is a graceful dead end.

Files starting with `_` (e.g. `_broadcast.py`) are **not** loaded as
rules — they're shared helpers for the pass's rule modules.

### Drivers

`Pipeline.build(passes)` wraps a pass list; the resulting object exposes
three entry points:

- `Pipeline.run(graph, *, backend=None, db=None) -> Graph` — single-shot
  compile via `TuningSearch(max_visits=1)` with no prior (uniform PUCT →
  emission-order descent). Stops at the first terminal candidate.
- `Pipeline.tune(graph, *, search, backend=None, db=None) -> Iterator[Candidate]` —
  autotune sweep. Pass a `TuningSearch(patience=, ucb_c=)`; the iterator
  yields one terminal `Candidate` per fully-explored rollout.
  `Pipeline.tune` benches each terminal via `_bench_terminal` (writes
  per-kernel `perf` / `lowering` / inventory rows, returns the aggregate
  `PerfStats`), then calls `search.observe(stats, status)`. With
  `backend=None` the bench is stubbed to `latency_us=1.0` and nothing
  is persisted — otherwise `Pipeline.run` (also routed through `tune`)
  would overwrite tuned `best_median_us` rows with the stub.
- `Run.drive(graph) -> Iterator[tuple[token, Candidate]]` — the inner engine loop both wrappers drive.
  `Run` is the per-run state object (`pipeline` + `ctx` + `search` + `db` + `backend` + `dump` +
  `rejections`): `Pipeline` stays a frozen, shareable pass layout while every run-scoped sink and service
  lives on the Run, reached from engine-adjacent code through the candidate (`cand.run.dump`,
  `cand.run.rejections`, `cand.ctx`). `drive` seeds the root candidate, then per iteration pops a
  `LazyCandidate`, resolves it, runs one rule batch, pushes successors under the pop's token. Selection is
  `TuningSearch`'s job (PUCT over the learned prior; a single-shot compile, prior absent, descends
  emission-order). (The DB-best replay path `_best_fork` and the `best=` push argument were nuked — see "no longer drives
  selection" above; the perf DB still *records* every bench as the prior's training data.)

### The keying map: two identities

Everything the search stores or replays is keyed by one of TWO identities — when adding a cache or a
table, pick one; don't invent a third:

- **Variant identity = `(context, knobs)`** — anything *predictive or replayable*. The `S_*` structural
  features (`loop/fusion/992_stamp_structural_features`: a stmt/op histogram + loop extents + operand dtypes) make
  the merged knob dict a COMPLETE identity, so a prior is a pure function of it: the score cache keys
  `(ctx fields, frozenset(merged knobs))`, the planner's op-metadata plan stamp keys the same plus the
  `DEPLODOCK_*` pin snapshot (pins are context-side: environment that gates enumeration). The *learned*
  prior is exactly `score(features(ctx, knobs))`: the structural facts (op histogram, extents, dtypes) are
  already in the knob dict, so `knob.knob_features` turns it straight into the model feature vector (the
  `S_*` knobs pass through; tuning knobs encode by type, `MMA` expands to atom props). See the learned-prior
  section below.
- **Measurement identity = `(ctx.structural_key, op_cache_key)`** — ground truth about *materialized
  leaves*: `perf` rows, op inventory (`loop_op`/`tile_op`/`kernel_op`/`cuda_op`), `op_effort` gating, and
  two-level dedup. The structural `child_key` on `lowering` rows is measurement linkage (it joins the
  inventory), NOT a replay key.

### Search persistence: on-disk inventory vs in-memory MCTS

The autotune state is split across two cooperating modules:

- **`SearchDB`** (`search/db.py`) — SQLite store partitioned into six
  tables: `loop_op`, `tile_op`, `kernel_op`, `cuda_op` (one row per op
  encountered along any lowering chain, keyed by `op_cache_key`), a
  `lowering` edge table (one row per rewrite hop carrying the knob
  delta the rule stamped at that hop plus a best-median upsert, so
  `GreedySearch` can replay the chain by matching forks against the
  delta at each step), and a backend-partitioned `perf` table carrying
  full stats (`latency_us_{median,min,max,mean,variance}`,
  `n_samples`, `backend`, `status`, `knobs`). Selection statistic is
  the median.
- **`SearchTree`** (`search/policy/mcts.py`) — pure-Python in-memory
  MCTS state, colocated with `TuningSearch` because MCTS is the only
  policy that reads it. Each tree node wraps a `LazyCandidate`; nodes
  carry `visits` and `best_reward` (max reward over the subtree's
  measured leaves), plus a `live` counter that filters out subtrees
  whose frontier has been fully drained. Lineage is TOKEN-THREADED, not
  call-order-dependent: `pop()` returns `(token, candidate)` (the token
  IS the `SearchNode`), the engine pushes children with `parent=token`
  and observes the terminal's measurement with the same token, so the
  tree stays correct however the engine interleaves pops / pushes /
  observes. Rebuilt fresh each process; cached `perf` rows in the DB
  ensure no re-bench on warm starts. `GreedySearch` has no tree (its
  tokens are `None`).

`Pipeline._bench_terminal` is the only function that knows about all
four parts (graph, DB, tree-through-`search.observe`, backend). It
short-circuits when every `CudaOp` in the graph already has a `perf`
row for the current `(context_key, backend)` — no GPU bench, stats
reconstructed from the DB. Otherwise it does one
`backend.benchmark(...)` call, walks `Op.source` once to record op
inventory + lowering edges + the `perf` row per kernel, and returns
the aggregate `PerfStats` (summed across kernels) for the search to
score.

## Tuning workflow

The autotune loop selects one tile-lowering variant per CudaOp by repeatedly running the lowering pipeline with
different knob choices at each fork point, benching the produced kernels, and steering subsequent rollouts toward the
configurations that produced the lowest measured latency.

### Two-level search: outer fusion MCTS + inner separable per-op tuning

`deplodock tune` does **not** run one MCTS over the whole graph. The pipeline applies rules sequentially, so two very
different kinds of fork — **op-variant** forks (tile / pad / stage choices for one kernel) and **fusion** forks (how ops
group into kernels) — would nest and cross-product under one global patience. That cross-product is what starved deep
ops (the bottleneck kernel exhausted patience before an SDPA P@V kernel reached its good tile). The two kinds have
opposite structure, so `search/two_level.py` splits them:

- **Outer search** (`run_two_level_tune`) drives only the graph-changing passes (`OUTER_PASSES` = `frontend` + `loop`,
  i.e. `LOOP_PASSES`). A **terminal** is the state where the cursor would advance into `lowering/tile`
  (`partition_loops`) — every op post-fusion and structurally final. Each terminal is a candidate fused graph; its
  **reward** is `1 / Σ best-per-op time` from the inner search, backpropagated by the reused `TuningSearch`. **Today
  fusion is deterministic** (no rule emits a multi-option *fusion* fork — see `autotune_no_graph_forks`), so the outer
  tree has exactly one terminal and this reduces to "tune each op once, sum, assemble". The outer tree is the
  generalization that lets fusion forks plug in later with no change to the inner search. The outer uses
  a `Run` directly (manual `observe`) since its reward comes from the inner tuning, not `_bench_terminal`.
- **Inner search** (`inner_reward`) tunes each finalized kernel **independently** in its own single-node slice
  (`single_node_graph`, `search/slice.py`) with a plain `TuningSearch` over `LOWERING_PASSES` only (`tile → kernel →
  cuda`). The slice keeps the root kernel + its leaf-op closure and turns every other kernel-input into a synthetic
  `InputOp`; the root op is shared **by reference**, so its body — and thus `op_cache_key` — is byte-for-byte the
  full-graph op's. Lowering-only (never re-running `loop/fusion`) is what keeps that body untouched. Because the inner
  tree holds one op, MCTS explores only that op's forks with `patience` as the op's own budget — `Σ_k n_k` benches,
  never the product. **Leaves are deduped by `op_cache_key`** before iteration: 24 RMSNorm LoopOps across 24 layers
  collapse to one work unit, and the outer `total_us` accumulates `best * multiplicity` so the reward stays
  multiplicity-weighted (bit-for-bit the same as per-node iteration). `OpResult.multiplicity` carries the count;
  positions = `sum(r.multiplicity for r in reward.per_op)`. The progress denominator is the deduped count, so
  Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B's ~14 unique kernels show as 14/14 not 14/337.

**Separability + the structural handoff.** Op-variant forks are separable: every multi-option fork is an in-place `Op`
rebind that leaves the graph unchanged, so whole-graph time is `Σ_k t_k`. Results key structurally (`op_cache_key` =
name-invariant body+knobs digest), so a kernel tuned in its slice transfers to the assembled graph unchanged **and** is
shared across outer terminals — two fusion candidates sharing an identical op reuse its tuning (a DB hit), so fusion
search only pays for the ops that differ. After the best fusion is picked, the assembled `Graph[CudaOp]` (greedy replay
of the DB-best forks over the original graph) is benched **once** for the real in-context whole-graph latency; comparing
it to the `Σ` estimate is the **separability check** — a gap exposes L2 / clock / launch coupling the isolated benches
can't see (in practice <2% for the small graphs above).

**"Terminated" effort — skip already-tuned ops.** Per op, the inner search is gated on persisted effort
(`SearchDB.record_effort` / `effort_for` / `terminated`, the `op_effort` table keyed by `(context_key, op_key)`). An op
is `terminated` when its recorded effort `>= patience`; the recorded value is `∞` once the op's inner tree **exhausted**
(the search drained without a patience stop, i.e. `stop_reason is None`), else the `patience` it ran with (max-kept).
This makes re-runs idempotent (`cached` in the summary), higher patience re-deepen only under-tuned ops, and the whole
sweep resumable across sessions. The inner search records the **best whole-slice total** (`Σ` over the slice's CudaOps,
so a split-K main + combine both count) under the LoopOp key via `record_perf`; `best_per_op_time` prefers that direct
row and otherwise walks the `lowering` chain down to the `cuda` terminal.

**Driving the loop.** `deplodock tune <model_or_ir | --code EXPR>` probes a `Context`, opens the tuning database
(default `~/.cache/deplodock/autotune.db`, overridable via `DEPLODOCK_TUNE_DB`), and calls `run_two_level_tune(...)`.
On completion it prints one `done: N fused terminal(s) in Xs` line — the deployable numbers come from the optional
`--bench` step below. The DB accumulates rows across runs; re-running resumes from the cached state.

On default verbosity (and a tty) a `commands/tune_progress.TuneProgress` draws a live single-line bar — completed/total
tuned op leaves plus a `<kernel> <current us> (best <best us>) <knobs>` tail. The current latency is fixed-width and the
variable-length `pipeline.variant_label` knob string sits last, so the prefix up to the knobs stays put as the
per-variant latency changes (only a new best, which is rare, shifts the trailing part — no flicker). It is threaded as an optional `progress=` through `run_two_level_tune` → `inner_reward`
(duck-typed, so the search package keeps no dependency on `commands/`): one op leaf ticked per kernel, the tail updated
per benched variant (read off `TuningSearch.last_stats`). `-v` disables the bar (the per-`[tune]` INFO lines show
progress instead); `-q` is quiet (errors only). `--bench` re-benches the tuned winner at **-O3** (deployable, not the -O1 ranking pass) after tuning —
the assembled full model **against the real torch module** (eager / `torch.compile` / Deplodock, via the bundle
plumbed from `load_or_trace` → `commands/run.bench_full_model_real`) and each kernel's `.torch.json` provenance
reproducer (re-lowered greedily so the tuned forks are picked) vs eager / `torch.compile` / Deplodock via
`commands/run.bench_lowered_vs_torch`, printing
full-model + per-kernel tables and (when a dump dir is set) an HTML chart at `<dump-dir>/kernels.html`.

**Search dynamics.** Each level reuses the **same** SP-MCTS (`search/policy/mcts.py`) — outer over fusion forks, inner
over one op's forks — with max-Q normalized UCB1:

- **Selection** is PUCT (`_select`): `Q_norm(c) + ucb_c · P(c) · sqrt(N_parent+1)/(1+N_c)`, where
  `Q_norm = child.best_reward / global_best_reward`, `reward = 1 / median_us`, and `P` is the softmax over the learned
  `CatBoostPrior`'s scores of the sibling set. The prior is the sole signal — greedy, the static
  `TileOp.score` tiebreak, and the `+∞`-unvisited UCB rule are all gone (see the learned-prior section).
- **Expansion** is implicit: `Run.drive` pops a node and runs one rule batch; every fork pushes one new child per
  alternative. The tree mirrors the graph's fork lineage.
- **Simulation** is the actual `backend.benchmark(...)` call on the terminal — for the inner search that is one real GPU
  run of a single-kernel slice per leaf.
- **Backprop** walks the popped candidate's `parent` chain up to the root, updating `visits` and `best_reward` so future
  UCB1 calls see the new max-Q.
- **Patience** counts terminals visited *since the last new global best*; when it exceeds `patience` (`--patience N`,
  default 50), `TuningSearch.stop_reason` is set and that level's `Pipeline.tune` / `Run.drive` exits. The inner
  search records `∞` effort when it instead drains its tree (no patience stop).

**Learned prior (`search/prior/`).** ONE global `CatBoostPrior` across every kernel, GPU and nvcc setting — not per-op,
not partitioned by regime. Op structure (`S_*`) and the host/hardware regime (`H_*` — GPU compute capability + nvcc opt
level, from `Context.features`) are **features in every row**, not a cache key. Training signal is **value-of-position**:
real benches exist only at leaves, but the prior ranks partial-knob siblings at every fork level, so the label for any
node is `log(best_reward)` — the max over its benched descendants, which `record_terminal` maintains on
`SearchNode.best_reward`. `TuningSearch._collect_rows` walks the live tree and emits `(knobs, label)` for every node with
a benched descendant (leaves **and** branches); `_node_knobs` accumulates the `fork.knobs` deltas under the op's `S_*`/`H_*`
base; `knob.knob_features` vectorizes.

Why CatBoost (chosen by `scripts/prior_bakeoff.py` over a multi-op tuning dataset): the model's greedy argmax must not run
off to a degenerate corner. A linear model (the former `BayesianRidgePrior`) is monotone in every knob, so its argmax is
always a corner of the candidate box — the `BR=1` blow-up (4us → 232us / invalid kernels). Any **bounded** tree ensemble
is off-manifold-safe (an un-benched extreme inherits the nearest leaf's value), and among them CatBoost also generalizes
to an *untuned* op near-perfectly (leave-one-op-out argmax ratio ~1.0 vs xgb/lgbm 1.18, rf 1.31) thanks to ordered
boosting + oblivious trees. So one global CatBoost prior is good enough on a new op that it is **not refit within an op's
own search** — it is a fixed model per run.

The dataset is bounded + batched (`base.Prior`): each tuned op's value-of-position rows stream into a reservoir-sampled
dataset capped at `MAX_ROWS` (100k — Algorithm R keeps a uniform sample of all rows ever seen, across runs), and the
model refits (`maybe_refit`) on a **dataset-size-tiered cadence** (`REFIT_SCHEDULE`) — frequently while data-poor, then
coarsening: every 100 rows up to 1k, every 1k up to 10k, every 10k from there on — then checkpoints. So the model warms
up fast on the first op (~10 refits inside the first ~1k rows) and settles to ~once per op once large. End-of-run does a
`maybe_refit(force=True)` so even a small tune that never crossed a tier still ends with a fitted model (above `min_rows`). The checkpoint is
a JSON file (`config.prior_path()`, `~/.cache/deplodock/prior.json`) holding the CatBoost `cbm` blob (base64) + the
dataset, via `deplodock.storage`; `tune` writes it, `compile` / `run` read it.

How the prior enters selection — **PUCT is the only rule** (`_select`): the prior is the *sole* signal; greedy-tiebreak and
the `+∞`-unvisited UCB rule are gone.

    score(c) = Q(c) + c · P(c) · √(N_parent+1) / (1+N_c)

`Q = best_reward/global_best` (0 if unvisited), `P = softmax` over the sibling set's (deterministic) prior scores,
`c = --ucb-c`. A low-`P` sibling gets a tiny exploration term → it is deprioritized instead of force-benched (no forced
breadth). A cold or absent prior yields a uniform `P`, so PUCT still explores via the exploration term — and a single-shot
compile descends emission-order (the option-0 pick) when no prior is loaded. The end-of-run sanity block (silly-pick rate
warmup-vs-post, self-calibration) prints once for the global prior.

**Greedy uses the prior too.** `Pipeline.run`'s `GreedySearch` (the O(1)-per-step `compile` / `run` driver) lazy-loads the
same global `CatBoostPrior` and picks each fork by `mean_score` argmax over the candidate's `{H_* , S_* , path-deltas,
fork-delta}` feature vector — the exact base the prior trained on. With no trained prior it falls back to the first emitted
sibling (option-0). (Greedy benches nothing, so it can only *use* a prior, never train one; routing whole-model compile
through `TuningSearch` would be O(N²).)

**Reading the result.** `_bench_terminal` writes one `perf` row per CudaOp per `(context_key, backend)` keyed on
`op_cache_key`, plus a `lowering` edge per rewrite hop carrying the knob delta the rule stamped (and the inner search
adds the whole-slice total under the LoopOp key) — the bench record / training data. A subsequent `deplodock compile` /
`deplodock run` does NOT replay these DB forks (the greedy DB→fork replay was removed with the learned prior); instead
`GreedySearch` picks each fork from the global `CatBoostPrior` (`mean_score` argmax, option-0 when no prior is loaded) —
see "Greedy uses the prior too" above. `run_two_level_tune` assembles its final graph the same way.

**Stub backend.** With `backend=None`, `_bench_terminal` short-circuits to `latency_us=1.0` and persists nothing — used by
test fixtures so `Pipeline.run`'s greedy compile doesn't clobber tuned rows with a stub when no GPU is available.

## Tunable knobs

A **`Knob`** (`knob.py`) is the canonical schema for one tuning dimension: name, type (`INT` / `BOOL` / `BINMASK`),
candidate `hints` (advisory — the rule still validates structural fit), and a short help string. Rules declare them as
module-level constants and stamp values into `TileOp.knobs` dicts; the autotuner reads those dicts back as the per-hop
knob delta in the `lowering` table. The registry (`knob.registry()`) auto-collects every `Knob` instance in every loaded
rule module — no manual registration.

**Pinning knobs from the environment.** Two equivalent forms:

- **Per-knob:** `DEPLODOCK_<NAME>=<value>` (e.g. `DEPLODOCK_BK=32`). Read by the rule that owns the knob (via
  `Knob.narrow`) or by `compiler/tuning.py`'s heuristics. The `DEPLODOCK_<NAME>` env-var key is built by
  `config.knob_var` and the value read via `config.knob_raw` / `config.int_env` — `deplodock/config.py` is the single
  owner of `os.environ` for all `DEPLODOCK_*` vars; `knob.py` keeps the `Knob` descriptor's per-type decode.
- **Aggregate:** `DEPLODOCK_KNOBS="K1=V1,K2=V2,..."` (e.g. `DEPLODOCK_KNOBS="BK=2,BM=16,BN=128,FM=8,FN=8,STAGE=111"`).
  Parsed once at `knob.py` import via `apply_knobs_env()`, which splats each entry into the corresponding
  `DEPLODOCK_<K>` env var (via `config.set_knob(..., overwrite=False)`) so all the per-knob readers pick it up
  uniformly. An explicit per-knob var wins over the aggregate (so `DEPLODOCK_BK=4 DEPLODOCK_KNOBS="BK=2,BM=16"` ends up
  with BK=4, BM=16).

Pinning replaces tuner choice: the rule sees the env value and emits exactly that variant instead of forking. Useful for
reproducing a tune-time variant from CI logs, A/B-comparing two configs, or pinning a known-good config in a Makefile
recipe.

Pinning is **authoritative** — an env value outside the knob's hint tuple is honored, not silently dropped. `Knob.narrow`
returns `(pinned,)` regardless of hint membership; downstream structural gates (divisibility, threads-per-CTA budget,
TMA eligibility, …) still apply, so a structurally invalid pin yields an empty enumeration and the per-call-site
fallback (`_enumeration._run(apply_pins=False)`) takes over. This lets a tile shape that the planner wouldn't reach
on its own — e.g. the article's BM=8, FM=26, fat 208×128 matmul tile — be explored manually, while peer kernels with
incompatible divisibility still get a sensible default.

**Registered knobs.** All knobs in `passes/lowering/tile/*.py`:

| Knob                 | Type      | Owning rule                   | What it controls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `FK`                 | INT       | `010_partition_loops`         | Reduce-axis multiple-accumulator factor (non-matmul reduces). Strip-mines the per-thread K serial loop into `FK` independent accumulators (a `RegisterTile(K_f, reduce=True)` inside `K_i`) for ILP; `010_split_register_axes` replicates the wrapped `Accum` into `acc_0..acc_{FK-1}` and appends a cross-accumulator tree-fold after the K serial loops, so the materializer/combine see one `acc`. Swept only as a divisor of the per-thread K-chunk extent, capped by `FK·FM·FN ≤ _MAX_CELLS_PER_THREAD`. **fp16 scalar matmul** reuses `FK` as the half2 accumulation-window length (= even `bk`): the planner keeps the FK=1 fp32 structure + stamps `FKWIN`, and `kernel/015_pack_fk_window` rewrites the window K loop into `__hfma2` packed multiply-adds over a `__half2` accumulator with a widen+horizontal-sum flush into the fp32 master each stage — bounded fp16 error for 2× packed throughput. `FK=1` (and fp32/bf16/MMA) is byte-identical to the pre-FK planner (it ranks first in the greedy tiebreak).

Not tunable — identity facts that make a knob dict a complete variant identity (the planner's value-keyed score cache). Stamped last in the loop dialect so every downstream keying (op_cache_key, tune DB, search-tree comparisons) sees one consistent knob set; `knob_features` turns the whole knob dict into the model feature vector.

| `MMA`                | STR       | `010_partition_loops`         | Three-way control for warp-tier MMA (tensor-core) matmul enumeration: falsy (`0`/`false`/…) forces the scalar-only path (debug / fallback); truthy (`1`/`true`/…) or unset (the default) auto-enumerates every eligible atom kind; any other value names an atom kind (e.g. `mma_m16n8k16_f16`) — enable **and** pin that kind, incl. the force-at-any-arch pin-only path. `DEPLODOCK_ATOM_KIND` is its env **alias** (`Knob.aliases` — either spelling works; the primary `DEPLODOCK_MMA` wins when both are set). Not an autotune fork: the tuner picks warp-vs-scalar through the `ATOM_KIND` sibling subtree.

The greedy default orders the surviving variants by occupancy — front-loading the deepest depth that still keeps **2 CTA-blocks/SM** resident (`2 × depth × per-stage ≤ cap`), since past that the kernel drops to 1 block/SM and runs slower (measured 2048² fp16: 128×128 depth-3 = 115 µs vs depth-4 = 136 µs). This reorder fires **only for single-`StageBundle` kernels** (a pure GEMM, where the ring slab is the whole dynamic-smem footprint so the keeps-2 test is exact); a fused multi-bundle kernel (SDPA's QK+P@V) carries an intermediate cross-bundle workspace that dominates the materialized smem and is invisible to the ring-byte budget, so it keeps the shallow-first default (depth-2, always downstream-valid) — the autotuner still explores its deeper rings.                                                                                                          |

Autotune fork on depth-2 TMA rings (so `040_use_ring_buffers` front-loads `BUFFER_COUNT=2` on the warp tier to keep it eligible). Both consumer tiers: scalar `ThreadTile` (pointwise / coop-reduce) and the warp-tier MMA tower's `WarpTile` (`consumer_is_warp`). On the **64×64 4-warp** fp16 mma.sync tile WS=1 is the measured win (≈17%: 94 µs vs 115 µs at 2048²) and both greedy and the tuner now pick it; it was ~neutral at the old 128×128 tile, where the gap was mma-schedule-bound.

`BINMASK` parsing accepts a binary string (`"101"` = bits 0 and 2 set, char `i` = bit `i`), the keywords `"all"` / `"none"`,
or a decimal / `0x`-hex int clamped to the candidate width. `format_tuning_knobs` drops `BOOL` knobs from the rendered
`knobs=` line — they're treated as pass-presence markers, not values.

`HOIST_COMPUTE` is an autotune fork: `030_hoist_invariant_compute` emits both variants per fusable cone in a fixed
order (inline-fuse first as the greedy default — smaller smem, works on every architecture). Honors
`DEPLODOCK_HOIST_COMPUTE` for one-off pinning. `PAD_SMEM` follows the same shape in `070_pad_smem`: both polarities
fire whenever any source has a fixable conflict; the greedy run picks pad-on first. Honors `DEPLODOCK_PAD_SMEM` for
one-off pinning.

## Pass directories

Pass files are numerically prefixed so `sorted()` pickup is
deterministic. Pick a fresh prefix when adding a rule; the pass loader
ignores the prefix itself — it's only for ordering readability.

| Pass                       | What rules do                                                        |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `frontend/decomposition/`  | Rewrite frontend ops (`LinearOp`, `MatmulOp`, `SdpaOp`, layout ops, fused ops like `rms_norm`/`softmax`) into tensor-IR primitives + layout-only `IndexMapOp`s. Each rule emits broadcast-explicit IR via `_broadcast.broadcast_to`. |
| `frontend/optimization/`   | `compose_indexmaps`: collapse chains of single-source / single-consumer `IndexMapOp` into one coord_map — prevents trivial layout kernels from blocking fusion. |
| `loop/lifting/`            | `lift_*` rules wrap each surviving tensor primitive (elementwise / reduce / indexmap / gather) in a trivial one-op `LoopOp`. |
| `loop/fusion/`             | `split_shared_indexmap` (runs first) fuses a pure-indexmap `LoopOp` that fans out to ≥2 consumers into **all** of them in one rewrite — it inlines the producer's body into each consumer (reusing `splice_loop_ops`) and dissolves the producer via a single multi-output `Graph.splice` (`output={consumer_id: fused_id}`); a consumer the splicer can't take falls back to a private copy. Then `merge_loop_ops` splices the remaining adjacent single-consumer `LoopOp` pairs via `ir/loop/splicer.py::splice_graph`. The split is what lets the scalar-constant broadcasts torch.export folds into mask/RoPE scaffolding fold into their consumers (inlined as `float x = 0.0f;` literals) instead of surviving as standalone copy kernels (full Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B: 394 → 337 CUDA kernels). `dedup_loads` then drops identical `(input, index)` Loads within each fused body. Finally `stamp_loop_names` stamps `LoopOp.name` via `provenance.name_for` (e.g. `k_rms_norm_3f2a1b`) — runs last so the structural hash reflects the final fused body; the Tile dialect just forwards the name onto each emitted `TileOp` (and every dialect below copies it through unchanged). Shared `is_pure_indexmap` / `rename_write_output` helpers live in `_helpers.py`. |
| `lowering/tile/`           | Tile-IR structural passes — Stage formation, transport (cp.async / TMA), double-buffering, pipelining, smem padding. Order: `partition_loops` → `lower_atom_cell` (MMA-only: rewrites the warp-tier matmul cell into tensor-core form right after partitioning — reading the `Atom` spec off the enclosing `AtomTile.atom` (stamped there by `partition_loops`, no `ATOM_KIND` knob lookup), the `Assign(multiply) + Accum` collapses into a single `Mma` (`c += a @ b`) that carries that `Atom` spec (cell shape + operand dtypes) and names its A (M×K) / B (K×N) operand `Load`s by SSA value. The operand loads stay **plain** — the `Mma` is the sole tensor-core marker. Both flow through every staging pass as ordinary IR (the loads stage like any `Load`; the `Mma` keeps its reduce loop `is_reduce`), so the cell carries its tensor-core intent through the whole tile chain. The final lowering to the `ldmatrix` + `mma.sync` kernel chain is `kernel/005_lower_atom_tile`, which recovers each operand's role from the `Mma`. Idempotent / scalar TileOps skip; see `plans/mma-fragment-factorization.md`) → `gate_splitk_residual` → `stage_inputs` → `hoist_staged_loads_above_mask` (lifts a masked-tile boundary `Cond(decoded < bound, ...)` from `010_partition_loops`: any K-pipeline stmt — `StageBundle` itself, plus `SerialTile` / `StridedTile` whose subtree carries one — is hoisted ABOVE the Cond so the cooperative load fires on every CTA thread (TMA's elected issuer / cp.async's full-CTA fan-out would otherwise be gated out). Un-staged gmem Loads in the hoisted body whose index references a gated var are wrapped in an inner `Cond(predicate, body=cone)` covering their forward SSA cone. Skips `==` Conds (the SPLITK invariant-compute guard) and bare Conds with no staged transport. Deterministic, no knob — split out of `020_stage_inputs` so the staging walk is uniform and the Cond-shape rewrite is focused) → `swizzle_blocks` (default-on
L2-friendly CTA swizzle for matmul-priority TileOps — stamps `GridTile.swizzle_group_m = DEPLODOCK_GROUP_M`,
default 8, so the renderer emits a Triton-canonical `blockIdx.x` remap; identifies matmul kernels via
`TileOp.knobs` rather than the axis-suffix convention because the body-normalizer renames axes by the time
the pass runs) → `unify_sibling_stages` (drops a `StageBundle` Source whose `buf` was already staged by a
prior sibling scope and reverts its consumer Loads back to gmem — keeps the fused RMSNorm + linear `x_smem`
single-allocation invariant when the matmul-side K_i, now visible as a reduce through transparent
`RegisterTile` wrappers, would otherwise re-stage `x`) → `hoist_invariant_compute` → `use_ring_buffers` →
`use_tma` → `use_async_copy` → `pad_smem` → `pipeline_stages` → `mark_unroll`. Coordination (split-K atomic-writes, cooperative-K Combine emission, broadcast-write guards) is no longer a separate pass: the materializer / Kernel-IR render derives those decisions from `ir/tile/escape_analysis.py` queries against the tile body. Cooperativity is derived from `Accum.axes ∩ ThreadTile.axes`; atomic writes from enclosing `GridTile.axes` vs `Write.index`. `015_gate_splitk_residual` reuses the same `Body.coordination.atomic_axes` signal to identify the split-K block axis without any axis-naming convention or role tag — when SPLITK > 1, it wraps a `matmul_add`-shape linear residual epilogue under `Cond(K_s == 0, ...)` so the residual is atomic-added exactly once across the K_s CTAs (rewrite + predicates live in sibling `_splitk_residual.py`, shared with `010_partition_loops`'s `force_splitk_one` enumeration-time gate). The partition planner's knob globals + per-mode candidate tuples + the pruned `(BN, BM, FM, FN, BK, SPLITK, BR)` cartesian generator + per-mode priority/score functions live in sibling `_enumeration.py` — `010_partition_loops.py` imports the `enumerate_cartesian` entry point; rows are plain knob dicts, so tests can hit `_enumeration` directly without routing through `_plan_kernel`. `split_register_axes` / `permute_lane_accesses` used to live here but moved to `lowering/kernel/` once dtype-aware analytical passes consolidated there (see `plans/stamp-ssa-dtypes-and-reorder.md`); they still pattern-match `TileOp` because they run pre-materialize. |
| `lowering/kernel/`         | Pre-materialize dtype-aware analytical passes plus the final `TileOp → KernelOp` lowering. Order: `lower_atom_tile` (MMA-only: lowers the tensor-core matmul cell — plain operand `Load`s + an `Mma`, carried in from `tile/011_lower_atom_cell` through the staging passes — to the `"mma_sync"` s16816 kernel chain: `RegFragment` decls + per-reduce `LdmatrixLoad a`+`LdmatrixLoad b`+`MmaSyncPtx` + final `RegStore` (the `ldmatrix` + `mma.sync.aligned` register-array path). Operands are matched per reduce site via the `Mma` (which names its A/B operands by SSA value); the fragment SSA names are seeded once from the FIRST reduce site (stable across prologue/inner/epilogue for the per-cell replicator); each `LdmatrixLoad.src_index` is rebuilt per cache-axis (each `Var * block`) with `ldm` from the inner source dim's slab stride by re-harvesting the live `Source`s. mma.sync is smem→register only, so an unstaged operand raises an actionable `LoweringError` here (naming the `DEPLODOCK_MMA=0` / `TMA=1` remedies) — the atom-vs-scalar fork was already decided at `tile/010_partition_loops`, so there is no scalar sibling left to fall back to and a silent skip would leak the unconsumed `AtomTile` to render and crash opaquely. Strips the `AtomTile` wrapper. The `rewrite` entry point and its lowering helpers all live in this one module. Scalar TileOps skip; see `plans/mma-fragment-factorization.md` and `plans/mma-smem-staging.md`) → `split_register_axes` (replicates REGISTER-tagged bodies per-cell, with dep-tracked single-copy preservation of axis-invariant statements — for MMA kernels, replicates the Mma* chain per (M_r, N_r) cell, threading per-cell fragment SSA renames via the `Mma*.rewrite.register` handlers) → `dedup_replicated` (content-agnostic CSE: structurally identical Loads / Assigns left over after replication fold into one — the same shape the deleted blocked-GEMM builder used to produce by hand-partitioning N-invariant cones; see `plans/obsolete-blocked-gemm-builder.md`) → `place_inits` (places explicit `Init` Stmts at correct accumulator scope — descends into a `WarpTile`-wrapped `WarpSpecialize` to land the Init at the **consumer_body head**, above the consumer K loop and inside the role split; placing it higher would let the renderer's default per-loop init fire inside the loop and reset the accumulator every K chunk. A `Cond` wrapping a `Write` (the masked-boundary output store of a register tile — `if (coord < N) out[...] = acc`, emitted for non-divisible extents) is a per-iteration output escape just like a bare `Write`, so the crossable-reduce check treats it as non-crossable and the Init lands inside the register-M loop; without that the mask hid the escape and accumulators leaked across register-tile rows) → `stamp_types` (single body walk populating `Load.dtype` / `Assign.dtype` / `Write.value_dtype` / `Source.dtype` from `graph.nodes[buf].output.dtype`; also forces fp32 for overflow-prone ops — a square `multiply(a, a)` or any `pow` — so RMSNorm's mean-of-squares of large fp16 activations (e.g. Gemma's q/k pre-norm ±200s, whose square exceeds fp16's 65504) computes in fp32 like torch's `.float()`, rather than overflowing to inf → garbage reduction; distinct-arg `multiply` (matmul) stays fp16) → `demote_to_write_dtype` (folds f16-only chains feeding f16 Writes) → `vectorize_loads` (widens consecutive scalar Loads into LDS.128 / `__half2`) → `permute_lane_accesses` (chunks the N register tile into LDS.128-sized strips to remove bank conflicts on `FN > V`; skipped for MMA — `ldmatrix` handles its own swizzling) → `pack_fp16_pairs` (pairs scalar `__half` Inits/Accums into `__half2`; skipped for MMA — the C fragment IS the accumulator) → `vectorize_stores` (widens consecutive scalar Writes) → `flatten_wrap_stages` (flattens wrap-body `Stage(... body=[consumer])` into `[Stage(empty), *consumer]` so the materializer walks producer scaffolding then consumer siblings) → `materialize_tile` (purely-mechanical Tile → Kernel lowering; Smem decls read `Source.dtype` directly, and swizzled TMA operand slabs align to their full swizzle atom (`8 × swizzle_width` B: B128→1024, B64→512, B32→256) so the coordinate-only `ldmatrix` XOR matches the hardware's absolute-address swizzle (non-swizzled TMA stays at the 128 B box recommendation); its emit logic lives in sibling `_`-prefixed helper modules `_stage_expand` / `_combine` / `_tma_groups`, which the pass loader skips) → `drop_redundant_syncs` (Kernel-IR peephole collapsing back-to-back / leading `Sync`s at the tile-body level). All passes through `flatten_wrap_stages` pattern-match `TileOp`; `materialize_tile` consumes `TileOp` and produces the `KernelOp`; `drop_redundant_syncs` rewrites `KernelOp → KernelOp`. |
| `lowering/cuda/`           | `lower_kernelop` renders the `KernelOp` body to a `__global__` source string (via `ir/kernel/render.py::render_kernelop`) and mutates the node's op to `CudaOp` in place. |

See `ir/ARCHITECTURE.md` for what each IR dialect looks like.

## Dump hooks (`dump.py`)

`CompilerDump.on_pass(idx, pass_name, graph)` dumps the post-pass graph
uniformly for every pass: `NN_<pass_name>.{json,txt,dot}` (+
`NN_<pass_name>.kernels.txt` if any node has a non-empty
`pretty_body()`). Slashes in the pass name are flattened to
underscores, so `lowering/cuda` dumps as e.g. `06_lowering_cuda.*`. The
pre-pipeline input graph is dumped separately as `00_input.*` via
`dump.dump_input_graph(graph)` from the caller.

The uniform strategy means adding a new pass automatically gets dumped
— no per-pass registration needed. Rendering the kernel-level IRs
(loop/tile/kernel/cuda) lives in `format_kernels(graph)`, which calls
each op's own `pretty_body()`. Node ids accumulate `merged_` per
fusion step and a leading `lift_` from lifting; `_canonical_node_id`
collapses both for display, and the rendered body is rewritten with
the same map so `Load`/`Write` references match.

Per compute kernel, `_dump_per_kernel` also writes `<prefix>.kernels/<kname>.json` — a standalone sub-graph (kernel +
its `InputOp`/`ConstantOp` producers) loadable via `deplodock run --ir`. When op provenance is present (see
`compiler/provenance.py`), it additionally writes `<kname>.torch.json` + `<kname>.torch.txt`: the **original Torch ops**
that kernel implements, sliced from the pristine pre-decomposition graph stashed in `dump_input_graph`, with an `i/N`
coverage header per origin (full vs partial). Because the slice is taken from the original graph by origin id, it is
always made of whole Torch ops — runnable via `deplodock run --ir <kname>.torch.json --bench` to reproduce accuracy /
latency vs torch for exactly those ops.

## Per-rule diff output (`rule_diff.py`)

At `compile -vv` (DEBUG log level) the engine emits one block per rule application: a unified diff between the
matched subgraph before the rewrite and the rewritten fragment, bracketed by `>>> <pass>:NNN_rulename` and
`<<< <pass>:NNN_rulename` markers on their own lines. The `<pass>` prefix is the single-letter shorthand from
`PASS_SHORTHAND` (`d`=decomposition, `o`=optimization, `l`=lifting, `f`=fusion, `t`=tile, `k`=kernel, `c`=cuda) —
the same letters the CLI accepts in `--passes dolft`. Skipped rules (`RuleSkipped` exception) collapse to a
one-liner `--- <pass>:NNN_rulename skipped at <root>: <reason>`.

`PASS_SHORTHAND` is the single source of truth: `commands/compile.py` imports it to build its `--passes` shortcut
expander, so the CLI flag and the `-vv` marker prefix can never drift.

The bracketing makes per-rule and per-pass slicing trivial — `awk '/^>>> t:005/,/^<<< t:005/'` extracts a
single rule's diff and `awk '/^>>> t:/,/^<<< t:/'` extracts the entire tile-lowering pass. ANSI color (`+` green, `-` red, `@@` cyan) is applied only inside the diff body, so the markers
stay plain ASCII and `awk` matches reliably even on colored output. Color follows
`compile --color {auto,always,never}` (default `auto`: tty-aware, honors `NO_COLOR`); diff context and a
fallback line cap are tuned via `--diff-context N` and `--diff-max-lines N`. `RuleRenderConfig` is set once from
`commands/compile.py:handle_compile` via `rule_diff.set_config()`.

The structured `.rules.json` dump under `DEPLODOCK_DUMP_DIR` is unaffected — the diff is purely a presentation
layer for the human-readable `_rule_texts` channel.

## Fragment splice (`engine._apply_replacement`)

1. Walk the fragment in topo order. `InputOp` nodes forward their id to
   the existing graph node (external reference); non-Input nodes are
   added to the graph with fresh ids.
2. `replace_node(match.output or match.root_node_id, new_output)`
   rewires all consumers (and `graph.outputs` slots) from the old
   output to the fragment's output id.
3. Merge hints from every consumed node into the new output.
4. Remove consumed nodes and run `_remove_orphans` to drop any now-
   dangling constants/inputs.

## Invariants

- A rule module must not reach into the engine's internals; its
  interface is `PATTERN` + `rewrite(graph, match)`.
- `pipeline/` imports from `ir/` but never from `backend/`. Lowering
  rules produce IR; actually executing that IR is the backend's job.
