# Program-form Architecture

Each IR dialect that has "kernel launches" has a matching *Program* form.
The IR describes one unit of compute (a single loop nest, a single GPU
kernel); the Program describes many of them wired together into a
runnable whole, with authoritative buffer metadata.

```
Graph (frontend → tensor → loop IR, populated in place by rewrites)
   │ pipeline.compile_graph
   ▼
LoopProgram    ← program/loop.py  +  ir/loop.py
   │ backend/cuda/emit.compile_kernels
   ▼
GpuProgram     ← program/gpu.py   +  ir/gpu.py
   │ backend/cuda/program.generate_source

## `loop.py` — LoopProgram

Pairs with `ir/loop.py`. Produced by `LoopProgram.from_graph(graph)`
after fusion completes.

| Type | Role |
|------|------|
| `LoopBuffer(name, shape, dtype, role)` | One buffer. Shape is authoritative; `size` is a derived property. |
| `LoopLaunch(loop, input_names, output_name)` | One `LoopOp` invocation wired to named buffers (Port order). |
| `LoopProgram(name, buffers, launches, graph_inputs/outputs/constants, constant_values)` | The full post-fusion program. |

`LoopProgram` exposes shape queries — `shape(name)`, `input_shapes(launch)`,
`output_shape(launch)`, `dollar_shapes(launch)` — so codegen never
recomputes shapes.

**Rule:** No `aliases` field. At loop level, identity/metadata-only
IndexMaps are absorbed into `Port.indexmap`; there's no separate
metadata-only-alias concept here (unlike `GpuProgram`, which has
`aliases` for buffer-pointer aliasing at the device level).

## `gpu.py` — GpuProgram

Pairs with `ir/gpu.py`. Produced by `backend/cuda/emit.compile_kernels`
by lowering each `LoopLaunch` to a `CudaLaunch(GpuLaunch)`.

| Type | Role |
|------|------|
| `GpuBuffer(name, size, dtype, role)` | One buffer. `size` is element count (resolved from `LoopBuffer.shape`). |
| `GpuLaunch(kernel_source, kernel_name, grid, block, args, smem_bytes, zero_outputs)` | One GPU kernel invocation. |
| `GpuProgram(name, buffers, launches, defines, includes, aliases)` | The full device program. |

Backend-specific subclasses (`backend/cuda/program.py::CudaLaunch`) add
fields like `tma_descriptors`.

## The symmetry

Each level's Program is:
1. **A bag of buffers** — the data plane with roles + sizes/shapes.
2. **An ordered list of launches** — the control plane, each referring to
   one IR unit (`LoopOp` or `GpuKernel`).
3. **Program-level metadata** — inputs, outputs, constants, (for GPU:
   defines, includes, aliases).

Lowering between two Program forms is the natural home for:
- **Codegen** (`LoopProgram → GpuProgram`)
- **Buffer allocation / liveness** (as a pass on `LoopProgram`)
- **Launch-order optimizations**

Each transformation stays at one program level or lowers between adjacent
levels, never reaches back into the Graph.
