"""Shared helpers for the ``loop/fusion`` rules.

Lives in a ``_``-prefixed module so the pass loader skips it (only
``NNN_<name>.py`` files are loaded as rules — see ``Pass.load``). Both
``010_merge_loop_ops`` and ``005_split_shared_indexmap`` import from here,
so the pure-indexmap predicate and the Write-output renamer stay defined
once. The splice/fragment plumbing of a producer→consumer merge
(``build_merged_op`` / ``wrap_merge_fragment``) also lives here so the
post-split re-fusion rule (``lowering/tile/006_merge_split_glue``) reuses
it under its own guard set instead of duplicating the assembly.
