# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Deplodock is a Python tool for deploying and benchmarking LLM inference on GPU servers. It supports vLLM and SGLang engines, provides a CLI for local and remote (SSH) deployment of models via Docker Compose, plus automated benchmarking across multiple servers.

The `README.md` is intentionally short — example-driven, no narrative. For details, consult the ARCHITECTURE.md files:

- **CLI usage** (deploy local/ssh/cloud, bench, teardown, vm, hardware-aware deploy, fixed-host mode, experiments, CI workflow) → [`deplodock/commands/ARCHITECTURE.md`](deplodock/commands/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Recipe format** (matrices/cross/zip combinators, variant filtering, deep merge, named fields, extra_args validation, command recipes, aggregate, docker_options, driver/cuda pinning, SGLang) → [`deplodock/recipe/ARCHITECTURE.md`](deplodock/recipe/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Compiler** (Graph IR dialects, passes, backends) → [`deplodock/compiler/ARCHITECTURE.md`](deplodock/compiler/ARCHITECTURE.md) and child docs

When the user asks about a CLI flag, recipe field, or matrix combinator, read the relevant ARCHITECTURE.md before answering — they hold details that are no longer in the README.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+ with `venv`
- `make setup` to create the virtual environment and install dependencies
- Docker and Docker Compose for local deployments
- `HF_TOKEN` environment variable for HuggingFace model downloads
- `DEPLODOCK_DUMP_DIR` environment variable (optional) — when set, all compiler stages dump intermediate artifacts (graphs, CUDA kernels, execution plans) to this directory for debugging
- `DEPLODOCK_TUNE_DB` environment variable (optional) — overrides the default tuning SQLite cache path (`~/.cache/deplodock/autotune.db`); `--tune-db` on `deplodock tune` / `deplodock run` takes precedence

## Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

Or for a specific test file:

```bash
./venv/bin/pytest tests/test_recipe.py -v
```

When running a large subset (e.g. `tests/compiler/`), pass the same xdist flags `make test` uses to parallelize:

```bash
./venv/bin/pytest tests/compiler/ -p no:randomly -n auto --dist=loadgroup
```

`-n auto` spawns one worker per core; `--dist=loadgroup` keeps tests sharing an `xdist_group` (e.g. CUDA context) on the
same worker.

## CLI Commands

- `deplodock deploy local ...` — deploy locally via docker compose
- `deplodock deploy ssh ...` — deploy to remote server via SSH
- `deplodock deploy cloud ...` — provision a cloud VM and deploy via SSH
- `deplodock bench recipes/* ...` — deploy + benchmark + teardown on cloud VMs (recipe dirs as positional args)
- `deplodock bench recipes/* --filter "KEY=PATTERN"` — run only variants matching the filter (fnmatch glob, repeatable, AND logic)
- `deplodock bench experiments/...` — run an experiment (results stored in the experiment dir)
- `deplodock teardown <run_dir>` — clean up VMs left running by `bench --no-teardown`
- `deplodock vm create gpu --gpu NAME --gpu-count N [--provider X]` — create a VM by GPU name (orchestrator: retries, candidate fallback, orphan cleanup)
- `deplodock vm create gcp ...` — create a specific GCP GPU VM (single-shot manual)
- `deplodock vm create cloudrift ...` — create a specific CloudRift GPU VM (single-shot manual)
- `deplodock vm delete gcp ...` — delete a GCP GPU VM
- `deplodock vm delete cloudrift ...` — delete a CloudRift GPU VM
- `deplodock pull <model>` — download a HuggingFace model to local cache
- `deplodock trace <model> [--layer N] [--seq-len N]` — trace a transformer layer (or the whole model if `--layer` is omitted) to Graph IR (JSON). Whole-model tracing patches HF's dynamic causal-mask construction via `trace.huggingface.build_full_model_wrapper`.
- `deplodock trace --code "EXPR"` — trace an inline `nn.Module` expression (last stmt must be a call, e.g. `"torch.nn.RMSNorm(2048)(torch.randn(1,32,2048))"`)
- `deplodock compile <model_or_ir> [--layer N] [--seq-len N] [--dump-dir DIR] [--target sm_NN]` — run `decomposition → optimization → fusion` and save the fused `Graph[LoopOp]` (auto-pulls + traces if given a model ID; omit `--layer` for whole-model). `--target sm_NN` (e.g. `sm_80`, `sm_90`, `sm_120`) overrides the live device's compute capability so passes that gate on hardware features (TMA, cp.async) take the target's path.
- `deplodock compile --code "EXPR" [--ir STAGE]` — trace + compile an inline `nn.Module` expression in one step (same grammar as `trace --code`; last stmt must be a call)
- `deplodock compile <ir_file> --ir {torch|tensor|loop|kernel|cuda}` — print the requested IR stage to stdout. `loop` renders fused `LoopOp` bodies (post decomposition+optimization+fusion); `kernel` renders the per-kernel AST (post LoopOp→KernelOp lowering); `cuda` renders the per-kernel CUDA source (post KernelOp→CudaOp lowering).
- `deplodock tune <model_or_ir|--code EXPR> [--tune-db PATH] [--patience N] [--ucb-c C]` — autotune via SP-MCTS (max-Q normalized UCB1, rank-only `TileOp.score` prior). Pops candidates by UCB1, benches every CudaOp variant, persists `perf` / `lowering` / inventory rows to the SQLite cache, and stops on patience (N consecutive measured terminals without a new best). Prints the winning CUDA IR to stdout and a ranked variant summary to stderr.
- `deplodock run --code "EXPR" [--bench] [--warmup N] [--iters N]` — compile + execute an inline `nn.Module`/torch expression on the CUDA backend, check accuracy vs eager, and (with `--bench`) print a latency table comparing eager PyTorch / `torch.compile` / Deplodock. Same `--code` grammar as `compile --code`.
- `deplodock inspect <ir_file>` — display graph IR summary (op counts, inputs, outputs)
- Quick test model (ungated, Llama arch): `TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0`
- GPU benchmark model (ungated, 7B): `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B`
- Block benchmark script: `python scripts/bench_block.py --model TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 --seq-len 32`

## Key Make Targets

- `make setup` — create venv and install dependencies (includes ruff)
- `make test` — run `pytest` using the venv (skips `perf`-marked tests; see `tests/perf/ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- `make lint` — run `ruff check` and `ruff format --check`
- `make format` — auto-format code and fix lint violations
- `make bench` — run benchmarks (`deplodock bench recipes/*`)
- `make bench-kernels` — run per-kernel perf comparison vs PyTorch (`tests/perf/`, requires CUDA)
- `make clean` — remove venv and generated files

## Documentation Conventions

**Wrap every `.md` file in the repo to ~120 characters.** This includes `README.md`, every `ARCHITECTURE.md`, every file
under `plans/`, every file under `docs/`, and any other markdown anywhere in the tree. Do NOT wrap at 70–80 characters —
that is the default markdown habit, and it is wrong for this repo. Aim for lines in the 90–120 range.

Table rows, ASCII diagrams, and long URLs may overflow past 120 if wrapping would hurt readability — that's the only
acceptable reason to go wider. Python code stays under 140 chars (Ruff-enforced).

## Contribution Instructions

IMPORTANT: You MUST follow ALL of these steps for EVERY code change. Do NOT skip any step.

### Writing code

1. Create a feature branch from `main` (e.g. `feature/my-new-feature`) — NEVER commit directly to `main`
2. Write code following guidelines in `STYLE.md`, `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` files in respective folders
3. Add tests if reasonable (in `tests/` following `tests/ARCHITECTURE.md` guidelines)

### Before committing (MANDATORY — do NOT skip these)

You MUST complete ALL of the following checks before every commit. These are not optional:

4. **Update `STYLE.md`** if any style changes were introduced — READ the current `STYLE.md` and compare
5. **Update `README.md`** if project setup, structure, or usage patterns changed — READ the current `README.md` and compare
6. **Update `CLAUDE.md`** if general instructions are no longer accurate — READ this file and compare
7. **Update `ARCHITECTURE.md`** files in every directory that was modified — READ each relevant `ARCHITECTURE.md` and compare
8. **Run tests**: `make test` — fix any failures before proceeding
9. **Run linter**: `make lint` — if it fails, run `make format` and re-check
